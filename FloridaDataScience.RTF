\f2\fs20 \cf0 In Netflix's summer hit "Indian Matchmaking," Mumbai-based matchmaker Sima Taparia consults an astrologer to assess whether a client is compatible for marriage with a potential partner. For those without an astrologer on speed dial, a new astrology-based dating app can provide an assist from the cosmos.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Like other dating apps, the recently launched Struck requires a profile, photos and personal details. But it also asks for your birth date, birth time and birth location to create a birth chart, also called a natal chart. Users receive matches once a day based on astrological compatibility after adjusting for location and gender preferences. And crucially, the app makes the natal charts of matched users available to each other - a feature that founder Rachel Lo says solves for the awkward moment when astrology buffs have to ask dates for birth times to explore their chart.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We caught up with Lo to ask this self-described "hardcore science girl" how she came to create this new dating app that boasts, "Skeptics welcome."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lo grew up in Southern California, studying mechanical engineering at Berkeley and eventually working at Apple and various tech startups in San Francisco before she had a "quarter-life crisis." In a quest to figure out a place in tech and the world, she began to use astrology as a way of understanding herself.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "I see it as a really great tool for speaking about your emotions in a language that a lot of us weren't taught to communicate," she said. "In my life and a lot of people's lives, astrology coexists with science and they're not mutually exclusive contexts."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 She saw an opportunity in an astrology-based dating app to bring together her interests in astrology and tech and to build something that slowed down the process of using a dating app. On Struck, users are limited to four matches a day with no ability to "swipe" through users like they can on Tinder. And in the midst of a pandemic that severely limits dating, the team is planning to incorporate games that users can play with each other in the app as well as a feature that includes natal charts of celebrities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some dating apps are like a bar where you try to talk to five to 10 different people in one night and try to find someone interesting, said Jordan Banafsheha, who used to work at Tinder and has served as an adviser to various dating apps. Banafsheha gave the Struck app a test drive early on and concluded: "Struck is more of being invited to a mutual friend's place and meeting one other person or two other people. It's a different context and higher intention."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Struck's astrology adviser is Nadine Head-Gordon, a former graphic designer who became a full-time astrologer with more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, where she is known by her professional name "Nadine Jane." She said that astrology cannot promise a soul mate but rather narrow down the dating pool. The app's algorithm compares planets on the charts of users that astrologers believe indicate personality traits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "We're trying to weed out the people that immediately you would not feel familiar with, feel chemistry or feel like there's a natural spark," said Head-Gordon. "And we're trying to match you with people where your first impressions and your general temperament are pretty well-aligned."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Head-Gordon said she had resisted invitations to consult on other astrology-based apps because she believed they were insincere efforts to capitalize on the popular resurgence of astrology. In Lo, however, she noted an authentic interest in astrology and a sound idea for what it could accomplish in the realm of dating. She was also drawn to the soul searching that Lo and her co-founder and product engineer Alex Calkins had embarked on after leaving Apple, where they'd first met.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their work history at Apple did not translate into an easy journey to get Struck published in Apple's app store. In fact, after eight months of development and thousands of dollars of personal investment, Lo and Calkins faced repeated rejections from the app review team, which suggested that the app was "spam" according to their guidelines that do not permit fortune-telling apps. After appeals and more rejections, Lo published an impassioned plea on social media.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "It's just very clear that the guideline was written by someone who doesn't fully understand the world of astrology, and we felt that it was pretty culturally insensitive," Lo said. "Whether you believe in it or not, astrology has been a huge, important piece of people's lives in the majority of the world for a very long time."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On Instagram, Lo made the argument that the ban negatively affected female developers because astrology is more popular among women and members of the queer community. Other than Calkins, all the people involved who have helped build Struck are women including two women of color and a queer woman who has supported 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  in the app.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After Lo's public message, her friend David Farrier published a story suggesting that "Apple's astrology ban disproportionately affects female-led businesses and developers." Within 24 hours, Apple reversed its decision and the app was approved to publish in its app store.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Struck is available only in Los Angeles, the Bay Area and New York City, with plans for more cities in the works. Lo said they have received requests for expansion in U.S. cities and as far as Australia, Brazil, Spain and the United Kingdom. For now, it's free, though they are considering a paid monthly subscription model. Lo, Head-Gordon and the team encourage those who are skeptical about astrology to give it a whirl.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "You don't have to take everything in the app as facts or some predetermined fate," said Head-Gordon. "My favorite phrase is take what you like and leave the rest."

\f2\fs20 \cf0 AI can't replace humans, but the technology is making inroads in more and more business sectors.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In an oft-quoted interview with Life magazine in 1970, Marvin Minsky, an MIT researcher and pioneer in artificial intelligence, predicted that scientists were about three to eight years away from creating a machine as intelligent as the average human. Such a machine would "be able to read Shakespeare, grease a car, play office politics, tell a joke, have a fight," Minksy said, and it would learn at such a "fantastic speed" that it would reach genius level within just a few months.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fifty years later, Minksy's vision of a machine on par with the human brain still hasn't been realized - but popular AI tools, such as Google's search engine and Apple's Siri, have become part of everyday life, and machines are learning how to master an array of complex tasks, from operating self-driving cars to spotting tumors to monitoring crops.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "It's no longer, 'is artificial intelligence going to work?' It does work, and there's numerous applications that are out there - medical imaging, credit fraud detection, movie selections - that use sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to make business better," says Jeff McFadden, chief technology officer for Xonar Technology, a Largo-based company that designed an AI-enabled security surveillance system to detect weapons. "It's really moved out of that research area and moved into where it's really a commercially viable technology set."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The leaps forward have been made possible by powerful computer processing engines and advances in machine learning techniques. Computers with enough horsepower can crunch large data sets and use a series of algorithms to extract patterns and glean insights from that information. In Al recommendation systems, like that employed by Netflix, the algorithm looks at an individual's viewing history, considers the preferences of other members with similar tastes and evaluates other information to come up with a viewing suggestion. An algorithm in an intelligent credit card fraud detection service, on the other hand, flags suspect purchases by looking for outliers or anomalies that depart from a consumer's normal purchasing behavior.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 McFadden's Xonar uses an algorithm to spot concealed weapons based on their ultra-wide band radar signature. The system transmits an electromagnetic pulse toward a person as they walk through it. The pulse bounces back to a receiver. That reflected wave is then analyzed by machine's algorithm to see if it matches the shape, density and other characteristics of various weapons in its learning library. It's more discriminating than traditional technologies, which rely primarily on metal detection, and Xonar can differentiate between a knife or handgun and other harmless metal items, such as keys or money clips, making for fewer "false positives." It's also less obtrusive. McFadden says friends who've breezed through the system in place at the entrances of Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater didn't even realize it was there.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Inspired by neural networks in the brain, these "deep learning" systems can remember and build on observational patterns they find in data. In essence, they become smarter over time, but it's vital to control what data the systems receive. "The big AI in general, deep-learning specifically, learns everything. It learns what you want it to learn, but it learns what you don't want it to learn," McFadden cautions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In some cases, AI can outperform its human counterparts. A recent study in the journal Nature found that a Google AI system did a better job in predicting breast cancer from mammograms than radiologists did. And a new AI software engineered by the British company DeepMind has created a system of algorithms called AlphaFold that can rapidly and reliably predict the 3-D shape of proteins - a task that usually takes months or years. The breakthrough is expected to speed up and reduce the costs of pharmaceutical development.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Here's a closer look what companies and researchers across Florida are doing with AI technology and why the experts say it will never completely replace humans.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 UF technology is helping orange growers count their trees and optimize tree growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Orange trees were easier to count before citrus greening struck. Fields were relatively uniform then, and farmers who had planted 160 trees per acre on 10 acres knew with reasonable certainty that they had about 1,600 trees. But when greening swept through Florida about a decade ago, groves became riddled with gaps where diseased and dead trees once stood. To get an accurate count, growers had to hire workers to drive through their groves, counting each tree, one by one, with a clicker.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "It was very time consuming and very expensive," says Yiannis Ampatzidis, a University of Florida scientist stationed in Immokalee. To address the problem, Ampatzidis and his research team developed a system called Agroview that uses special images taken from drones and the ground to count the trees and assess their conditions. The method isn't perfect, but it's close. It tallied 175,977 citrus trees at one Hendry County farm with close to 98% accuracy. It's also quick, taking about 10% as long as a manual count.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Florida growers seized on the technology in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture began requiring them to submit accurate tree inventories to maintain insurance coverage. Others have used Agroview to pinpoint gaps in groves so they can replant where dead trees once stood. Growers can also use the technology to detect disease and optimize the health of plants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Agroview combines multispectral imaging and leaf analysis. The drones carry special cameras that capture image data of the trees across a broad portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, including wavelengths invisible to the eye. Data from those images are then fed into Agroview's AI software, where they're cross-referenced with data from leaves that have been analyzed in labs to identify plants with nutrient deficiencies, diseases or other types of stress. Armed with that information, growers can fine-tune their application of fertilizer, pesticide and other inputs. If the system indicates low levels of nitrogen or phosphorus, for instance, the grower can increase his application of those nutrients in the affected areas. If nutrient levels are high, the grower can ease up. If disease is detected, the grower can apply a treatment early, before it spreads through the entire crop.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Farmers can purchase Agroview through a UF spinoff company called Agriculture Intelligence. The company will also collaborate with drone operators if growers don't have their own drone to collect the data. "Right now, we're working mainly with citrus, but tomato and other crops, other profiles, will come soon," Ampatzidis says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 UF researchers are also collaborating with a farm equipment company in Clewiston called Chemical Containers to develop a "smart sprayer" that uses AI and "sensor fusion" for precise application of insecticides and weed killer. "If you have a traditional sprayer, it will spray everywhere with the same amount, but that doesn't make sense," Ampatzidis says. "If you have a big tree, you need more chemicals to be sprayed, but if it's small, half the size, in theory you need half. If it's a gap, you don't spray at all."

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Salvador Dali, the Spanish surrealist painter, died in 1989 at age 84. But visitors to the Dali Museum in St. Petersburg can interact with a life-like version of the artist that's been re-created using artificial intelligence. Unveiled in 2019 on what would have been Dali's 115th birthday, Dali Lives was created using AI and a faces-wapping technique known as a deep-fake. Using archived interview footage and other historical materials, an AI algorithm designed by San Francisco-based Goodby Silverstein & Partners was able to master Dali's mannerisms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Following 1,000 hours of machine learning, the AI tool generated a likeness of Dali's face that was superimposed over an actor's body and synced with a voice impressionist to create a talking digital replica of the flamboyant artist. The resulting exhibit includes 125 interactive videos, with 190,512 possible combinations depending on user response, meaning no two visitors are likely to have exactly the same experience. Museum visitors are treated to a selfie taken by the digital Dali that they can receive via a text message before they leave the museum.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nvidia and UF are partnering to create "higher education's most powerful AI supercomputer" (rendering). All colleges at the university are building AI courses related to their area of expertise.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After graduating from the University of Florida in 1980 with his engineering degree, Chris Malachowsky landed his first job at Hewlett-Packard in California, where he designed a central processing unit, or CPU chip. He leveraged that experience into his second job at Sun Microsystems, where he worked on computer graphics until 1993, when he and some colleagues decided to start their own company, Nvidia.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the years since, Nvidia has transformed visual computing and come to dominate the artificial intelligence landscape with its graphics processing unit, or GPU, technology. Now, the Silicon Valley company is partnering with the University of Florida to supply an AI supercomputer that works with UF's existing HiPerGator system to create "higher education's most powerful AI supercomputer," which will be capable of delivering 700 petaflops of AI performance, or 1 quadrillion operations per second.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The public-private partnership is anchored by a $60-million donation - including $25 million from Malachowsky and $25 million in technology, training and services from Nvidia. UF will contribute $20 million. The school has also committed to hiring 100 faculty members focused on AI and plans to incorporate AI broadly across its curriculum.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While the school already offers courses in machine learning and AI ethics, each college at the university is building AI courses related to its area of expertise. UF's College of Business, for instance, is working on an AI course that will focus on AI in financial technologies. "We want to make it possible for every student who graduates from the University of Florida and who'd like to learn about AI the opportunity to either become acquainted with it, to become competent in it or become an expert in it," says Joe Glover, UF's provost and senior vice president of academic affairs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Glover says anyone in the State University System will be able to use its new supercomputer for educational purposes to teach students about machine learning and AI. Researchers at all the State University System schools will have access to the new supercomputer for educational purposes at no charge to teach students about machine learning and AI. UF will also provide limited support and training for using its computer resources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The partnership comes at a critical moment, with the federal government warning that United States is lagging in churning out AI-trained workers. "We think we have a unique approach here to helping to solve that issue. We intend to create the next generation of the AI-enabled workforce at scale, graduating 5,000 to 10,000 people who are going to pour into the economy and bring those skills with them to whatever their chosen occupation is," says Glover.

\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ulas Bagci, an assistant professor in University of Central Florida's department of computer science, has been working with an international team of researchers to develop AI tools that are helping doctors and nurses across the globe manage COVID-19 patients.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Using images from chest CT scans, their algorithm is able to predict which patients have COVID-19 and the infection's severity, helping health care providers identify which patients need to go to ICU, which are likely to need intensive care or die and which ones can go home based on inflammation it detects in the lungs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The AI technology has proved especially helpful in countries such as Italy, Japan, China and the U.S. "The hospitals are full of COVID patients. They need to manage them in the optimal way," Bagci says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bagci has developed similar predictive algorithms to diagnose lung cancer and pancreatic cancer from CT scans and MRI images. He says the algorithms can accomplish in seconds what it takes radiologists "ages to do." But he says the AI tools are not a replacement for their expertise, but rather an enhancement to lend them support and point them to the problem. "A human should always be in the loop for a trustworthy AI," he says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the classroom, Bagci likes to use the "cat behind the tree" example for his students. "Let's say there's a cat behind a tree and on one side you see the head and the other side you see the tail. You understand, as a human, that there is only one cat. But artificial intelligence is too artificial. It allows for two cats. It will give labels like cat 1, tree, and cat 2," he explains. "With high-level knowledge, we are much better than AI, and for high-risk applications, none of these deep-learning algorithms give you reason. It's good. It's really helpful, but it's not going to replace humans. True intelligence is not there."

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Chakri Toleti, a serial entrepreneur from the Orlando area, was taking a sabbatical "in between companies" in 2018 when he learned that his 78-year-old mother had fallen in a bathroom in India. She was stranded there for nearly 30 minutes before a caregiver found her. She recovered, but the incident motivated Toleti to create a company called 
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Care.ai
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that makes AI-powered autonomous patient monitoring systems for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Toleti says the system was inspired by his experience building motion capture systems at Disney 25 years earlier and sensor technology like that used in self-driving cars. 
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Care.ai
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  relies on similar tools - including sensors and an AI-powered "learning library" of behaviors and movements - to predict when a patient is at risk of falling or wandering off. If it senses something worrisome, it alerts nurses. It can also detect whether workers are washing their hands, delivering medications or coming in to check on patients when they should, in effect creating a "self-aware" room.
\f0\fs24 \

The touch-free screening tool - which is used at Tampa General Hospital, Rush University Medical Center in Illinois and other facilities across the nation - has a contact-free thermal sensor to detect feverish visitors, sending a message to staff if a person's temperature exceeds 100 degrees.

\f1\b Deepblocks, early property analysis software
\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Growing up in Cuba, where she lived until she was 10 years old, Olivia Ramos spent lots of time in the office where her mother worked as an architect. "At the time, they had no computers, so it was all a bunch of pencils and rulers, and I fell in love with all the little gadgets," she recalls.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Two decades later, Ramos is perfecting her own gadget - a high-tech software application called Deepblocks that uses data and deep learning to streamline and automate the process of early property analysis. Developers using the software can zoom in to a specific parcel, set their building parameters - square footage, number of units, parking, etc. - and the program spits out a 3-D visual of the project and an analysis with a projected return on investment that takes into account everything from market demographics (such as rent-to-income ratios) to local zoning rules.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "Zoning data, the rules of the city, are usually 400- page PDFs and are really expensive to go through and understand," says Ramos, who has a master's degree in architecture from Columbia University and a master's in real estate development from the University of Miami. "We developed models that understand that data and extract that data from those documents. You just select a piece of land, and it tells you what you can do."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The software can shave considerable time off development planning. It took one customer a year to do 21 iterations of a particular parcel that Deepblocks can help do in a few hours, and users can do as many models as they want, Ramos says. It currently includes parcel data for more than 1,000 U.S. cities and zoning data for 30 cities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Miami startup has a staff of six, including CEO and founder Ramos, and has raised $2 million through two funding rounds. It's raising $3 million in a third round. Real estate pros can buy a subscription to Deepblocks for $1,620 a month or $12,600 for a year. The software has seen a "big growth in adoption" amid the COVID-19 pandemic because people can't travel as easily to visit potential markets, Ramos says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The goal is for the software to make suggestions on opportunities in the market and determine the highest and best use of any property, Ramos says. When that happens, she believes Deepblocks will help tackle even bigger problems, such as a lack of affordable housing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "It's really, really hard to make an affordable housing project profitable, and it requires a lot of government help, so if we use the inefficiencies and understand what to build and how to build and where to build it, then that projects a lot of savings on the front end," she says. "Every single penny you save in affordable housing in cost, it's going to make that project more likely to happen."

\f2\fs20 Joe Dewey, a financial services and real estate attorney and "innovation partner" at Holland & Knight, says his firm has built an AI system that can generate about a dozen draft responses to pleadings for cases in high-volume practice areas. While a human must still sign off on the final version of a document, the law firm has been able to shave about two to three hours off the process of preparing a pleading. "With 50 to 100 cases a month, that starts to add up," he says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dewey sees bigger things on the AI horizon for the legal world - such as a deep-learning tool that could help an attorney draft a motion based on prior decisions issued by a particular judge, or an algorithm that could synthesize all existing case law on a topic and create a memorandum. "If you could get something that could do that at 70% to 80% accuracy, that would be a very valuable tool," he says. "The technology will need to evolve, but I think that's the direction we're headed."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Miami lawyer is skeptical that any machine could rival the human brain in a broad way. "For the most part, the machine learning models are good at one task. It's just a statistical model at the end of the day, and it applies the statistics to make a prediction about something," Dewey says. "They're very powerful with the tasks they're trained to do, but very limited, usually to a very narrow task. Beyond that, they're fairly dumb."

\f2\fs20 \cf0 When Ivan Garibay was invited to Washington, D.C., a few years ago to talk to lawmakers about artificial intelligence, many quizzed him about "the singularity" - a theoretical point in time when AI will surpass human intellect - and inquired about whether smart machines will be job killers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Garibay, founding director of the University of Central Florida's Complex Adaptive Systems Laboratory, told them the age of AI will be like other industrial revolutions. "Some types of jobs disappear, but it also brings new types of jobs," he said. "A few years down the road, we probably won't need Uber drivers or taxi drivers or truck drivers because AI's getting better and better at guiding cars, but that doesn't mean that many jobs won't appear in that new AI economy." As traditionally, retraining people with new skills, he says, will be key to weathering the disruption.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A 2019 report from the Brookings Institution suggests that the impacts of AI won't be evenly felt. Those in "better-paid, white-collar occupations" are among the "most exposed" to AI, although the "most elite workers - such as CEOs - appear to be somewhat protected," according to Brookings' analysis. The report says that jobs involving "pattern-oriented or predictive work" may be "especially susceptible," whereas low-paying "rote" jobs involving food preparation, health care and personal care may be less affected.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As for the notion of the singularity - "we're very, very far away," Garibay surmises. "That is something I don't even see in generations, having true intelligent machines that could replace or be a threat to humankind. It's almost like the Wizard of Oz. It's always amazing when you see the results, but when you see behind the curtain, you realize what's there is not as impressive. It's just mathematics and fast computers. I don't see it coming. Not in our lifetime at least."

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'85.Welcome Doug and Erica. First up, Erica what is your role? What do you do?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So my role is as the critical infrastructure key resources research group lead at the Army Cyber Institute, it\'92s a lot of words. What it basically means is my research group looks at issues within critical infrastructure; so industrial control systems. We\'92re looking at all 16 critical infrastructure sectors and how cyber attacks in those sectors can influence military operations such as force projection.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And Doug, you work with Erica on this. What do you do?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Bryson, yeah, I do. I am actually the chief data scientist here at the Army Cyber Institute. And prior to this, I was also working as the project lead for Jack Voltaic 3.0, which was our Jack Voltaic experiment that we ran in the cities of Charleston and Savannah that looked at the impacts of cyber attacks against commercial critical infrastructure on army force projection.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So what is the Army Cyber Institute?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So the Army Cyber Institute is basically a think tank for the army where we look at various cyber perspectives. And our goal is to look at least three to five years out, as opposed to looking at current problems right now. So like for example, with our force projection, right now we haven\'92t had a cyber attack interfere with any type of army force projection, but we\'92re exploring how it could and how we can mitigate that before it ever happens.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And Doug, just to keep it fun, what do you think the Army Cyber Institute is?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Well, as Erica said, the Army Cyber Institute, we\'92re that think tank. If you look across the spectrum of the army cyber community, you\'92ve got the operational arm, which is the army cyber command. You\'92ve got the educational training, which is the Cyber Center of Excellence down at Fort Gordon. And then the Army Cyber Institute represents that innovation part where we\'92re trying to look five, 10 years out. What\'92s going to be the next big thing in cyber that the army needs to think about and how can we better inform commanders and leaders throughout the army about the types of response and how we\'92re going to handle it.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 We\'92re trying to avoid strategic surprise.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So Erica, how do you define industrial control systems or critical infrastructure? You mentioned the 16 different SSAs being in scope.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Okay. So critical infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security defined it as 16 sectors. I hope you don\'92t want me to go down the list off of memory because I can\'92t. But basically what we\'92re looking at are those backbone pieces that keep our country running. So for example utilities, that\'92s the energy sector. And within the energy sector, you have gas and electric, which are not always necessarily provided by the same people. So you have those types of things, and what we look at industrial control systems, and again without going too far into the weeds, those are the actual physical pieces of hardware that run this backbone. So for example, if you\'92re looking at the energy sector and you\'92re looking at an electrical grid, there are very specific pieces of hardware in place to run that and they\'92re designed to run for 30 years without being replaced.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Well, as time has progressed and things have gotten more technologically connected, we thought, hey, wouldn\'92t it be a really great idea to put these things on the network so we could reduce sending people out to fix things and we can monitor and repair from a distance. Well, what happens to everything you connect to the internet? Other people want to connect to that thing. So those industrial control systems that basically provide your sensors for how your infrastructure is working and also gives it signals for example, open a relay, close a relay. Now that\'92s connected to the internet and so you have bad actors who are attempting to connect to that. And sometimes it\'92s just curiosity. People want to see how things work and they\'92re not necessarily bad actors and other times you have people who want to throw a monkey wrench in the system and want to have control for whatever reason.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 One good example is like a programmable logic controller, a PLC. It\'92s designed to be ruggedized in there for a very long time. And if you interfere with it, it can prevent electricity from flowing where it needs to, and then you have a problem within your grid that you either have to send a human out to fix, or you may end up having to also replace that equipment. And it\'92s so specialized that you don\'92t have your average IT person that\'92s really familiar with how these industrial control systems work. It\'92s more the realm of an electrical engineer than an IT worker. Does that answer your question?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Absolutely does. And Doug, I\'92d like to put you on the spot for the same question.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yeah. What Erica said is exactly right. I mean, you look at these sensors that we have out there, these industrial control sensors, and they are what help this critical or what make this critical infrastructure run. Now, where our work focuses is if something happens to one of these industrial control systems in the energy sector, what are the different interdependencies that exist with the other sectors? How does that carry over to that? You could look at, is this the same type of sensor that they may use over with water or with some other? So if there\'92s something wrong with the firmware there, are they going to have problems with that too? It\'92s really trying to capture how any kind of attacks against the critical infrastructure and the industrial control systems can perpetuate throughout the different sectors and then eventually and potentially cascade and create some very significant physical effects as a result of a cyber intrusion.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So what kinds of industrial control systems are there in the army?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 That is a very good question, Bryson. So we have a lot of the same industrial control systems that the civilian sector does. However, we\'92re a little bit different inside the fence. So we do have programmable logic controllers. For example, on certain installations, we have our own water treatment plants to include like here at West Point. We have our very own wastewater treatment plant and therefore we have programmable logic controllers in there. We do run our own mini grids within the military. What we don\'92t have are some of the bigger hardware that you would see at a regional power distribution center or something like that, where the army has very similar things on a much smaller scale, I guess, is the easiest way of putting it.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I think it\'92s also interesting. We will get into this a little bit later about public private partnership, but while the army does have dedicated industrial control systems to run core functions on a post, they also in a lot of cases depend on the local community and those utilities to provide different services as well.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Absolutely.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yes, Bryson, that\'92s correct. I mean, Erica mentioned about how West Point has their own wastewater treatment plant that\'92s located here. We\'92ve also seen where other installations have their own little part of the power energy grid that represents those, but there\'92s still that connection to the community that exists through the critical infrastructure that we have on our installations. And it can be slightly different for each of the installations that are out there.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And that\'92s a great segue into, what is Jack Voltaic?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So Jack Voltaic is a research series that has started to look at the interdependencies between civilian critical infrastructure and the DOD. And so the first iteration was born from a Cyber Mutual Assistance Workshop. So the energy sector for many, many years has had the concept of mutual assistance. If there\'92s a big storm in one part of the country, you\'92ll see teams being dispatched from all over the country to get those lines back in place and restore service in the effected areas. So a CW3 Judy Esquibel had the idea that what if we could do the same thing with cyber, and that was back in 2016. And so she put together a Cyber Mutual Assistance Workshop that brought in some leading industry players and worked on developing these public private partnerships and really bringing everybody to the table to say, what would it look like if we had to respond to cyber? How would our interdependencies affect that cyber response? How could we possibly assist each other?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And so after they had the first Cyber Mutual Assistance Workshop, they decided to try an exercise. So JV 1.0 was conducted in New York City and focused on a physical attack coupled with an attack on the financial industry as well as the subway. And what that showed was one, there are a lot of silos of excellence as we like to call them. Within each of the critical infrastructure sectors, there are communication pipelines where people report on incident, but there was not a lot of crosstalk between those different critical infrastructure sectors. And so after going through that, it actually led to the development of the New York City Cyber Command in order to have some type of unified cyber response and be able to minimize the amount of information that stayed within these silos. And we maintained a relationship with New York City and continue to do workshops with them even to the present day.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And after that, we looked at JV 2.0. We decided to take it a little bit further and do something a little bit bigger and looked at a hurricane coupled with an opportunistic cyber attack. And with that hurricane scenario, one thing we noticed was we kind of took the ports out of play. We wanted to know what would happen at our surface distribution and deployment command, which is an army\'85 our TRANSCOM battalion that focuses on the movement of army equipment. They participated, but because the hurricane closed down the port, it kind of took a lot of the cyber off of the table for them.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And so we had a lot of good findings come out of Houston. Some of the similar findings from New York City that we still have a lot of these silos of excellence by moving to another large city, they\'92re very, very responsive to the physical, their reaction to the hurricane is on point, they know how to react to that. They\'92ve hosted several large events. They know how to react to any type of physical issue. But when it comes to cyber one, it\'92s hard to know that it\'92s cyber at first. The first instinct is, hey, I have a glitch in my system, let me restart it. Or hey, I\'92m experiencing problems, I wonder if anybody else is, let me just wait and see what\'92s going on. And so that is still an issue.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And then we rolled into JV 3.0 where we wanted the ports back in play. And from there, I\'92m going to kick it to Doug because he really was the driving effort behind us doing a more regional scenario with two ports. So Doug take it away on JV 3.0.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Okay. Thanks Erica. And before I get into details of JV 3.0, I want to highlight something that makes the Jack Voltaic research, project unique. There\'92s a lot of different type of cyber exercises going on out there, but really what Jack Voltaic does, it takes a bottoms up approach to this critical infrastructure resilience by looking at the city level. So we\'92re not focused on region or multi-state, but the action is happening down at the city level where you\'92ve got the critical infrastructure in the populations at the highest concentrations. Furthermore, Jack Voltaic builds around the objectives and the goals of its participants. What we want to do is we want to explore what the different participants want to explore, because as Erica mentioned with Jack Voltaic 3.0, we wanted to bring the ports in play and look at how it impacts force projection. And we can do that by addressing some of the concerns or the objectives of the participants.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And then finally with Jack Voltaic, what makes it really unique is we\'92re not just looking at the ports, but we\'92re trying to pull in as many different critical infrastructure sectors as possible to see how the different interdependencies would affect one another. Because we understand that okay, you can do a direct attack or something against the ports that\'92s going to stop things. But what about the relationship between the port and the road network and the rail network and the energy sector? Is there going to be a small something that happens in the energy sector that could potentially cascade and impact the port? Jack Voltaic wants to look at those different interdependencies between the critical infrastructure sectors, and that\'92s really what makes it a unique event compared to some of the other great cybersecurity exercises that are going on out today.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Peeling it back a little bit more, can you explain what force projection means and why that precipitates a focus on ports?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yeah, sure. So when we talk in force projection, really for the army, we\'92re talking about moving people and equipment from the continental US to overseas somewhere where they have a mission and they\'92ve got to do operations. And so for us to do that, we have different assets available to us, whether it\'92s through air or sea. And the reason why the ports are in place is because we use sea vessels and sea lift as one of the primary means to get the equipment from the US to overseas. So that\'92s why it\'92s important to have the ports there because when you look at\'85 We talked earlier about public private partnerships. This force projection mission really is kind of a public private partnership in that we\'92re working\'85 the Surface Deployment Distribution Command that Erica mentioned before is working with the port to get vessels loaded to get them ready and get them sent on their way so that they can have the equipment and time there to meet the commander\'92s mission or give the commander the capabilities he needs to meet his mission overseas.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So how were the two of you paired together for this?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So that\'92s an interesting story. When I first came into the Army Cyber Institute, I had finished all of my PhD work, all the in-person work, basically. So all of my coursework and I was ABD, and so was Doug. So we both came in and we both had to finish. So when I came in, I hit the ground running on Jack Voltaic 2.0. I actually started before I even arrived at West Point. And then I also did a Jack Voltaic 2.5 Workshop Series. And that was in seven different port cities around the US. And so I didn\'92t have any time to work on my dissertation at all while I was also doing the Jack Voltaic lead. And so Doug finished his dissertation and it was masterful. He is a statistical genius.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So he stepped in and took over leading the next iteration of Jack Voltaic so I could finish my dissertation, which I did and graduated in May of this year. So then I was able to come back and he\'92s able to follow his first love and move back into the 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  statistical analysis side of the house. And I can do the strategy policy, the squishy cyber portion of Jack Voltaic that I love.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And I think the pairing too also though is to blend that squishy with the stats and really to try to capture a lot of data from this event and then use that data and provide different avenues of analysis, whether we\'92re looking at the different things that were said and extracting how they pertain to recommendations for policy or whatnot, or doing some natural language processing on that, building networks from there and moving forward there, or taking events that we\'92ve talked about in the Jack Voltaic 3.0 scenario and translating them to different simulations that provide a different pic or a different picture of what the participants experienced during that event. It was a great pairing, one that I think has been very effective for the Jack Voltaic series and I know especially for Jack Voltaic 3.0.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 You mentioned earlier the bottoms up approach to Jack Voltaic being one of the defining characteristics that makes it different. How do you choose the cities or the regions that are participating in this? How do you bring different government agencies and different elements of the private sector together?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So the selection of the cities in the case of JV 3.0 was based off of the army\'92s defender 2020 force projection exercise that they were moving men, women, and equipment from stateside to Germany to conduct an exercise in May. Looking through how that was going to flow, we identified that Charleston and Savannah were two of the key ports that were going to be moving equipment there. For Jack Voltaic 3.0 that\'92s how we decided on that. We also realized that, hey, there\'92s a regional relationship there that we can potentially explore which if something happens at one port, what\'92s going to happen at the other port? Are there any connections, any interdependencies that may exist there? So that was the thought process we went through when selecting for Jack Voltaic 3.0.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As to how to get people to come to the table, that\'92s basically getting on the ground and working the contacts. Unlike an army unit where we can request our headquarters to task someone to participate and they\'92re forced to participate, when it comes to Jack Voltaic we could walk in and say, \'93Hey, we\'92re the government we\'92re here to help,\'94 but we\'92ve really got to go in and build the relationships with the communities, describe to them what we\'92re trying to do, relay to them how it can help them, talk to them about what they\'92re experiencing, what they want to get out of it. And then from there, you start expanding out and pulling more and more people get it.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And what we found is, when we go into these communities, they\'92re generally excited to do this. They want to do these cyber incident response exercises because that\'92s something\'85 They\'92re great when it comes to physical responses. Whether it\'92s a hurricane, they\'92ve got that down. But when it\'92s a cyber incident, there\'92s still a little uncertainty about how are we going to do that. And so once we get in there and we start making some contacts, they tend to reach out and bring in more people that would be interested in participating. And so we\'92re able to build that coalition of the willing to put together this event.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So to piggyback on that, JV 1.0 was more proximity than anything else. It was a proof of concept type thing. Is this something worth doing, something worth exploring? Are we going to get good information out of it? So with New York City only being an hour up the road, it was a lot easier to put something together. And then from there, we\'92ve had volunteers. We always have more volunteers than we have resources to conduct Jack Voltaics. But for Houston we had volunteers who said, \'93Look, we\'92ll do a lot of the leg work. We have a lot of the existing relationships and we just want you to pick us.\'94 And so the folks down there in Houston really, really came together and did a lot of the trust-building and coalition building for us.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 JV 3.0, because it was tied to an army exercise was unique in that we had to do a lot more of the relationship building and trust building ourselves. And so that JV 2.5 Workshop Series that I mentioned, which basically shared the findings from the previous iterations of Jack Voltaic and then also did like a mini exercise. We conducted those in Charleston and Savannah in order to gauge how they would feel about having a JV there. The other option would have been Beaumont, Texas, but they had already participated in the one in Houston. So we weren\'92t quite ready to revisit the same place we had already been and we\'92re trying to still explore new places. And so even now we have plenty of volunteers but we\'92re limited in the resources we have to plan and conduct these exercises because it takes 18 to 24 months, especially with us coming from the outside, doing the relationship building and trust building with these cities.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What have you learned from the multi-year effort with Jack Voltaic?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So one of the big lessons is we still have a lot of the same issues with these silos. I would say first and foremost, prioritizing cybersecurity still isn\'92t happening. I mean, we have all of these attacks that are happening on a frequent basis. And when it comes down to it, resources are the hardest part. People don\'92t have the time, the personnel, and the funding to really be able to beef up their cyber security in the way that they should. And so we see that time and again. And then we also see the identification of a cyber problem tends to take longer than it should.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Within our scenarios, it\'92s kind of artificially built in. In the future, we\'92re trying to move to where people have more of an opportunity to identify that there\'92s a cyber issue. But as we conduct these tabletop exercises, we ask people what they think it might be. And it\'92s rare that we get people thinking it\'92s something cyber on their own. Obviously because it\'92s a cyber exercise, they figure at some point it\'92s got to be cyber, but they\'92re not sure. And then that leads into another repeated finding and that\'92s who has the authority to declare a cyber incident, and what does declaring a cyber incident even look like? Because there are resources you can bring to bear once you declare an incident, but knowing how to declare it and what the channels are for notifying that there\'92s a cyber incident and requesting resources, those mechanisms just aren\'92t really solidly in place right now at the municipal level.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Whereas on the other side, I participated in a national tabletop exercise that had representatives from government agencies. And at the national level, they like to reiterate that they have these plans and if something were to go wrong, they\'92re fully ready to deal with them. But the disconnect is, the local level is the front line. That\'92s where the problem is going to happen. The national level is where the resources are, and they\'92re the ones who can probably solve the problem. But there\'92s no solid connection between that local municipality and the federal level in order to make these things happen. And that\'92s what we\'92re looking to try to improve, getting people to understand how to make that connection.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yeah. And I want to add to that and say, what we see is at that municipal level where things occur that you don\'92t have that catastrophic, hey, the power grid is shut down. You don\'92t have some catastrophic effect that requires the immediate allocation of federal assets to the problem and fix it. Instead, it\'92s kind of small things. The traffic lights aren\'92t working right. Basically our HR systems are infected. And so we can see that, we can start working on that, but these smaller incidents that might go under the radar, what we try to look at with these is how do they cascade to where we can get to a threshold where someone can say, \'93This is a cyber incident, and I need help.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I think, as Erica mentioned, we\'92ve tried to help bridge that gap between the perception at the higher echelons and the perception at the city level. That\'92s one of the great things about our unique approach to this is that we\'92re able to provide that change of perspective in cyber incident response and allow more input to go back and give the feedback to what our current plans are.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I would also like to kind of highlight here. One of the things that JV does is it brings the operators and the leaders to the table at the same time to where they can talk and they can see how each other\'92s operate, where an IT or cybersecurity professional would see something and then how they communicate it to the leader and what the leader\'92s response is.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 With that, Erica kind of hinted on it is that there\'92s still not understanding of cybersecurity as a platform issue. It\'92s something that at, especially at the local level, would you rather have a robust cybersecurity program or fix potholes. And so helping people or communicating that cybersecurity has to be part of that platform that all leaders need to understand at every level. And we see evidence of that throughout the past couple of years where small towns in Texas are getting ransomware, City of Baltimore, City of Atlanta. It\'92s not a problem that you can overlook. And so emphasizing that for leaders to start emphasizing that that\'92s part of their way of helping protect their communities and helping to provide for their welfare of their citizens, I think is one of those things that we\'92re also trying to achieve with the Jack Voltaic series.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If you had your druthers, where would you want to take it?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So for me personally, the next one I\'92d like to see would probably be another regional one. And I\'92d like to see it tied to either a global defender that basically is looking at moving equipment from the US to Europe, or there\'92s also the INDOPACOM region, the Pacific Command region, which would allow us to conduct it in Hawaii. So that would be another nice opportunity, but it would also be regional looking at that connection between the West Coast of the US and Hawaii and the rest of the PACOM region.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yeah. And I\'92d like to add on to that too. I think there\'92s a lot of opportunity here to help improve the public private partnership between an installation and the surrounding community. And I think what we saw with Jack Voltaic 3.0, where we had 3rd ID along with Savannah and Hinesville, Georgia in there is there\'92s opportunity for these types of events to help an installation better understand how its critical infrastructure relates to the community, but also to help improve the relationships between the community and the military as well.

\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 All right. So this is how we close out each of these shows. So Erica, we\'92re going to give you two questions first. Actually, you know what, do you want to mix it up and make Doug go first?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yes.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yes, let\'92s do that. Then you get the time to think while he has to answer the questions. All right, Doug, for all the money on the table, if you could wave a magic non-internet connected wand, what is one thing that you would change period, anywhere bigger than Jack Voltaic? If you could wave your wand to change critical infrastructure, what would that be?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I really think the one thing I would want to change or improve on is how information is shared across critical infrastructures. And how we get that information out there? Because as we saw with events throughout the Jack Voltaic series, whether it\'92s 2.0 or 3.0, something that looks like an anomaly in one sector could be critical information for another sector to know. And it\'92s just, how do you get that sharing to occur, not just across critical infrastructure sectors but also from city up to federal. In the cyber domain, you\'92ve got to have that clear situational understanding from left and right and top to bottom. And I think if I could wave a magic wand, that\'92s what I would look for.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Well, now you\'92ve waved your magic wand. It\'92s very pretty. Now looking into the crystal ball for a five-year prediction, what is one good thing and one bad thing that you think is going to happen?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I think the good thing that I see happening is the communities are understanding more and more about what cyber can do, and there is a desire to do something about it. And so I think that movement, especially at the city and county level, they understand that it could be a challenge and they\'92re looking for ways to improve themselves with that. The bad thing I think is that as we continue to improve our cybersecurity posture, our cyber incident response posture, our adversaries are adaptive. And I think whether it\'92s 5, 10, 15, 20 years down the road, I think that while we improve, they\'92re still going to find ways to get around that. And I think until we can get ahead of our adversary, then we\'92re always going to be in this catch-up type of game.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 All right, Erica, have you composed yourself?

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I have.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Doug Fletcher:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Aren\'92t you going to ask her different questions?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 They\'92re the same questions. That would be funny. That would be great if I did mix it up and be like, \'93Are you ready? Now, completely something different.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So I\'92m like the person who wishes for more wishes. If I could wave my magic wand, I would want everybody to get it. I would want everybody to understand the actual risk. And from that, I would expect that people would get the business case for spending money on cyber security. I would expect that security would be baked into every piece of hardware that ever connects to the internet ever. I would expect that firmware would always be upgradable, and if it wasn\'92t, people would throw it out. And I would expect that privacy settings for devices that you connect to the network would be very granular, and you would be allowed to make decisions on your own home devices as well as our devices that we place on enterprise networks. So I\'92m the person who wishes for more wishes with my wish.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Bryson Bort:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 All right. You\'92re still on the hook for prediction.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Erica Mitchell:\'a0
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So my prediction is, the good thing that would come of that is that you would have a lot of inherent security. You would put adversaries in a defensive posture where they\'92ve got to work that much harder to get into your system. It\'92s not, let me go out on the dark web and grab some script kitty stuff and be able to get in, or let me use Shodan.io and find whole network devices or devices at state capitals because they\'92re out there. But the downside to it is really going to be expense. Security costs money and that expense is going to be passed on to consumers in the case of doing it as part of your business case and spending the money on security for your company. It\'92ll inevitably be passed on to consumers. And right now our economy is a little interesting due to COVID. However, I think once that initial expense happened, it would be much more manageable in ensuing years. So by the time you hit the five-year mark, you would probably be reaching more steady state operations, although your past five years you would have taken a bit of a loss.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I really want to say that the Jack Voltaic series does offer not just the army, but communities a unique perspective into cyber security and cyber incident response. It\'92s a tool that we can use to help us better understand this crazy domain known as cyber. But most importantly, it\'92s a tool that I think\'85 and something that we can help get after all of these wishes and dreams that we\'92ve talked about here, but also to just help the country be more secure and help the country be more resilient. As we\'92ve seen with how we\'92ve developed and refined responses to physical incidents, I believe that we just got to continue to practice and look at how we can get better and get to where cyber incident response, they get the same repetitions and feeling for that.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And for me, I just want to add that we are still pursuing the Jack Voltaic research objectives, and actually our way forward moving on, we\'92re looking to automate a lot of the process to reduce that planning time from 18 to 24 months to preferably days. So be on the lookout in the future for possible beta testing of a planning tool if you\'92re a municipality that\'92s looking for a way to self-assess where you\'92re at with your critical infrastructure security. And I appreciate you having us today, and I always love to be able to proselytize about security.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The expanded Early Voting period has begun here in Texas and questions persist\'97is this the safest way to vote? That depends on your criteria for safe voting. Is it the ability to vote without the threat of COVID-19? Or is it ensuring that your vote counts in what has already been a contentious election season?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Social distancing practices that have enabled Texans to shop for groceries and return to a semblance of normalcy, while still seeing the active case rate drop in Texas. This suggests that it is safe to vote in person. As for the question on your vote counting, that\'92s a little more difficult to pin down.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 On the morning of Nov. 4, Americans expect to know who the president of the United States will be. But 2020 may have other plans. Many states will not have complete results until up to 14 days after Election Day due to mail-in ballots. Between a massive increase in ballot requests, a rush to expand to mail-in ballots for all in certain states, and the inevitable lawsuits, America isn\'92t likely to learn who the winner is until weeks or even months after the election.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to the New York Times, swing states like Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have seen increases in mail-in ballot requests of 67%, 133%, 2,313%, and 648% respectively. Michigan and Wisconsin currently allow for ballots to be accepted as late as 14 days and three days after Election Day. These ballots are required to be postmarked no later than Election Day, but often the USPS doesn\'92t postmark ballots. With such a huge increase in mail-in ballot requests, the inevitable delay in vote counts, and the narrow margin of victory in these states by President Trump in 2016, we could see these important states swing in favor of a different candidate days or weeks after the election.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In a time when our nation is on edge, this is a recipe for civil unrest, not to mention for a storm of litigation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We had a small snapshot of this during the 2000 Presidential Election between then-Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. It came down to confusion in the state of Florida and challenges eventually made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, because 2020 is already one for the record books, we would see this same scenario but orders of magnitude worse.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Now, setting aside the likelihood of delayed election results, mail-in ballots are far less likely than voting in person to result in a vote as intended. According to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study published in the Harvard 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Review, as many as 4.9% of mail-in ballots fail to convert to a vote. This could happen because the signature on the ballot doesn\'92t match the signature on record, the ballot arrived late, or even because ballots are lost in the mail. During the presidential primary elections, more than 550,000 mail-in ballots were rejected due to various issues.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Not only do mail-in ballots have a higher potential for being lost or rejected, they are particularly susceptible to fraud. Right here in the Lone Star State, a mayoral candidate in Carrollton was caught red handed fraudulently stuffing ballots.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When we answer the question of the safest way to vote in 2020, we must consider which way will ensure your vote counts. The facts show that mail-in ballots have a much higher potential for fraud and disenfranchisement, and that voting in-person is safe\'97and the most certain way to ensure your vote is counted on time.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There\'92s a prevailing theme out of Texas that the state is turning blue, that the inevitability of the demographic and cultural shift will lead the Lone Star State back into the Democratic column, as it was for most of its history as a state. This narrative is advanced by the media, Democrats, and even some Republicans, since the idea of a competitive Texas raises money and gets attention.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In early October, the Biden campaign announced it was\'a0reserving $5.8 million\'a0in television advertising in Texas. The story generated headlines nationwide, the obvious implication being that if the Biden camp was spending money in Texas, it was all over for Team Trump.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Of course, a TV ad reservation is like a dinner reservation \'97 it can be canceled without penalty. Most of that canceling occurred just a few days later. The head fake\'a0worked, the media having dutifully covered the story of Biden going big in Texas.\'a0In the meantime, the RealClearPolitics\'a0average\'a0of polls in Texas has the Trump-Pence ticket up 4.4 percent over Biden-Harris.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The real proof of a campaign\'92s attention to a state is where the candidate spends time. The candidate is (usually) a campaign\'92s most important asset. As of Oct. 15, neither Biden nor Harris had visited Texas. Trump has traveled out to the Lone Star State 11 times since last year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Is Texas Turning Blue?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The current flurry of breathless reporting out of Texas is focused on early voting. Texas voters were able to cast early, in-person ballots starting Oct. 13. Mail-in ballots already received by election officials were also processed, but not unsealed, that day, resulting in a large first-day number, which is typical. Subsequent days generally show a big drop-off. The busiest days of early voting in Texas are the first two days and the last two days, the latter taking place on the Thursday and Friday before Election Day.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If Texans such as former Rep. Beto O\'92Rourke are to be believed, the state with the biggest Electoral College vote prize after California \'97 the state Trump can\'92t win without \'97 is going blue in a big way. O\'92Rourke\'a0tweeted:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Is O\'92Rourke right, or is it all hype?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Early Voting Numbers Aren\'92t What They Seem
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Veteran\'a0Texas GOP consultant Derek Ryan\'a0pulled down the voter certificates for the first day of early voting, looking at both in-person and mail-in ballots, and found that 92 percent of everyone who voted on the first day had voted in past Texas election cycles. Does that 8 percent represent a surge? Maybe, though it\'92s important to note that Texas\'92 population is expanding at a rapid clip due to its pro-growth policies, with 7.3 percent more Texans this year than in 2016.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ryan also found that about 38 percent of first-day votes were by people who participated in the Democratic primary compared to 32 percent Republicans. This would seem worrisome for Republicans, but Ryan noted, \'93The first day of early voting is dominated by mail-in ballots and we know that Democrats have gone all-in on mail-in voting. After the first day, mail-in ballots will decline relative to early in-person voting.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Comparing the first two days of early voting from 2020 to 2016 in 13 of Texas\'92 largest counties \'97 Harris County is still reporting partial results \'97 comprising 49 percent of registered Texas voters shows no evidence of the surge in voting. This year, 10.97 percent of registered voters cast ballots by mail or in-person in the first two days of early voting in Texas. In 2016, the number in the 13 comparative counties was 10.26 percent. This is a 7 percent relative increase in the first two days. Breaking out the in-person from the mail ballots shows that 8.24 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the first two days in 2020 compared to 8.58 percent in 2016, a 4 percent relative decline.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mail-in ballots tell a different tale. The first two days of tabulation show that 2.73 percent of registered Texas voters sent their ballots in early by mail this year compared to 1.68 percent in 2016, a 62 percent relative increase. Again, with Texas having 7.3 percent more people than four years ago, there might still be \'93record numbers\'94 of voters even if the turnout percentage declined a bit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because Democrats have poured enormous efforts into harvesting mail-in ballots, the share of votes by mail will likely hit 15 percent or more when all the ballots are counted. In 2016, 5 percent of votes were cast by mail. Since the largest number of the mail-in ballots are received and processed on the first day of early voting, it\'92s likely that this year\'92s early turnout numbers will decline relative to 2016 as each day of early voting is reported.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mass Mail-In Voting Is a Bad Idea
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Texas is an excuse-required state for voting by mail, with registered Texans 65 and older automatically eligible, as well as those who claim disability or who will be out of their home county on Election Day. Democrats have been pushing for voters to be able to claim fear of catching COVID-19 at the polls as a disability, even going so far as mailing vote-by-mail applications to millions of voters and encouraging them to check the \'93disability\'94 box regardless of any actual disability that would make it difficult or dangerous to go to the polls in person. This effort has been\'a0ruled illegal\'a0by the Texas Supreme Court, though that hasn\'92t stopped partisans from trying.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While mail-in ballots offer campaigns a degree of certainty, allowing them to bank votes, they do lack the protections of voting in person, exposing the voter to potential pressure or intimidation, subjecting the actual ballots to being tampered with, and resulting in a lack of voter-ID requirements.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Furthermore, a\'a0study\'a0published in the Harvard 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Review and\'a0featured\'a0recently in the Washington Post found that as many as 4.9 percent of mail-in ballots fail to result in a counted vote due to voter errors and Post Office inefficiency. That\'92s 1 in 20. The Democrats\'92 big gamble on mail-in ballots could be a giant tactical mistake, resulting in a million lost votes nationwide.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The contest for Texas\'92 38 Electoral College votes, after two days of early voting, doesn\'92t indicate a surge in turnout. Rather the method of early voting is shifting from in-person to mail-in \'97 a shift that should subside as a share of overall votes as Election Day approaches.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There\'92s nothing about South Africa that makes it impossible to start a successful business here. Nothing that is, except the government. As the Free Market Foundation has been saying, high taxes and regulations add significant layers of uncertainty to the already risky process of starting a business.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is a lesser problem if you already have access to money and can thus afford things like lawyers and accountants, it is a much bigger problem for the enterprising young person living in a township. Some regulations are quite absurd. For example, if you want to start growing and selling medical marijuana (a business that many poor people in townships are already involved in, albeit illegally), you have to comply with the conditions of a license that could cost you R44,000 or more. This is according to regulations issued by the Minister of Health in April 2019.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nowhere in the economy is the difference between the haves and have nots as stark as in the economic sectors where the government applies the most stringent regulations. Ultimately, regulation causes the very thing that governments claim to hate: concentration of industry. The rich can afford to comply while the poor cannot, it is as simple as that.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is especially true of the financial industry. In recent years South Africans have been hearing calls from our latter-day socialists for the establishment of a state bank to service poor black people, but we already have proto-financial institutions in the form of the so-called mashonisas (loan sharks). The problem? South Africa\'92s elites confuse their own wants and needs with those of everyone else, especially the poor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This means that mashonisas are not recognized for the vital role they play in the lives of many poor people because their financial and credit needs are not the same as that of policy-makers. I still remember when I got my first job in 2012, I had to attend training for the first month without pay. Mashonisas filled the gap at least for the first three months, I used the loans to pay for transport and other costs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Reserve Bank, as the prudential authority, can also add further requirements based on their judgment of what is in the public interest. In reality, the public interest is in the eye of the beholder.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Now, mashonisas currently provide pay-day finance to people who do not qualify for loans anywhere else because of their risk profile, these businesses can be found in virtually any workplace in South Africa. Every workplace I have ever been a part of has had a resident mashonisa, even though most of these were illegal. It just goes to show that government cannot abolish a business for which demand exists, it can only drive it underground and make it riskier, including forcing market participants to engage in violence in resolving their disputes because they cannot take each other to court.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What would it take for a mashonisa or a stokvel to become a legal commercial or mutual bank?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It turns out that the requirements for a banking license in South Africa are explicitly anti-poor and anti-small business. For a mutual bank (bank in which depositors own the bank, (comparable to a stokvel), prospective entrepreneurs will require at least R10 million in capital. This is in addition to regulations on interest by the National Credit Act (which means if your customers\'92 profile is inherently risky you cannot adjust interest rates to account for this).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Reserve Bank, as the prudential authority, can also add further requirements based on their judgment of what is in the public interest. In reality, the public interest is in the eye of the beholder. I would say if a bank can attract depositors and borrowers, then, clearly, its operations are in the public interest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The South African government simply cannot claim to be pro-poor while the poor are confronted with so much regulation when they dare start their own businesses, even businesses that they are already running through the black market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 You might think the conditions for starting a mutual bank are bad, considering the capital requirements for a commercial bank. If you are considering registering your own banking start-up you will need a cool R250 million in capital. It is also forbidden for any single person or entity to own more than 15% of the bank, meaning an essential tool for raising venture capital is less available (exchanging equity for operating capital).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Clearly, setting up a bank is outside the reach of any enterprising poor young person who could start out taking small deposits (in the order of R100) and giving out small loans. This is despite the fact that mashonisas in townships and most workplaces in South Africa are already engaged in small-scale lending, illegally according to the current regulations. Considering the fact that banking in Europe began with small-scale money-changers and lenders that eventually grew into giant businesses, the current regulatory regime is simply not appropriate for a poor country like South Africa.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Politicians through regulation have created exactly the problem that they now propose to solve through further regulation and the creation of a state bank. South Africa is not lacking in poor black people who can start small businesses in the banking sector. It is the high start-up costs imposed by the government that make this virtually impossible. There\'92s no denying that a consequence of deregulating this sector would also entail an increase in the number of banks that fail. That would be fine, as long as customers have choice and access to banks that offer more or less security.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The market allows each individual to define their own risk appetite. Government regulation does not actually do away with this, it just makes it a privilege of the rich. The assumption underlying all regulation is that the poor cannot be trusted with risk while the rich can (remember, the higher the risk, the greater the reward). The cost of compliance invariably comes down to money: whether paying for consultants, paying for someone to spend time on your behalf filling in forms, capital requirements, license fees, etcetera.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The South African government simply cannot claim to be pro-poor while the poor are confronted with so much regulation when they dare start their own businesses, even businesses that they are already running through the black market. A pro-poor government would go on a massive drive to deregulate each and every sector of the economy, this would, of course, require ignoring the naysayers in their ivory towers who don\'92t know what it is like to go to bed on an empty stomach. Everyone who understands what it means to be poor will understand why it is a moral imperative of the highest order to deregulate the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Poverty will not decline until poor people are allowed to make their own choices. This is true whether we are talking about communal land, employment contracts or regulations on banking and other industries. Having choices also means the possibility of failure. If we cannot accept that poor adults are not children, poverty is going to be with us for a while yet.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Labour unions are undoubtedly the biggest obstacle to any positive reform, not because this particular group of individuals is somehow more evil than the rest of us. It is simply a rational response to the particular set of incentives that union bosses are faced with.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions are nominally democratic but their members face the same problems any voter faces in any representative democracy: the benefits of electing a given leader are concentrated while the costs are dispersed. This means that while every union member pays the same dues, this individual contribution is outweighed by the potential return due to elected officials in the form of salaries and controlling the union's invested funds.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Add to this the fact that the full negative consequences of union action are only felt by its members after decades, and it is easy to see why unions might not always promote the interests of those they supposedly represent. Therefore members of unions should seriously consider making changes to how their organizations are governed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is an internal union issue though and it is unlikely to make unions the sort of persistent thorn in South Africa's side it has been. The real problem with unions is the political favoritism they have been receiving from the government. It has magnified any internal governance issues and dealt a serious blow to the hopes of millions of poor people in this country.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions have a lot going for them in South Africa. The only equivalently favored class of people are likely the tenderpreneurs. Unions are in a political alliance with the ruling party for one, this means that they have the equivalent of a veto on that party's policies. As long as both parties want to stay in the alliance they have to take seriously what the other wants. This becomes particularly perverse when considering the role of education unions in thwarting any attempt at introducing meritocracy in the schools that your children have to attend.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions also have collective bargaining, this is a tool that allows employers and union representatives to set the conditions of employment for millions of workers in a particular sector. None of the parties involved in such an endeavor need to consider the interests of the unemployed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In fact, when it comes to unionized workers, there are good reasons not to consider the interests of the unemployed. Considering labor as one of the factors of production with an associated price like any of the others, it is clear after taking account of the law of supply and demand, that the best way unions can negotiate for higher wages for their members is through restricting the supply of labor. How can this be achieved in a country with an unemployment rate of 37 percent, including people who have given up looking for work?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It turns out that this is where the aforementioned alliance with the ruling party really makes a difference. You see, unions have the ability to negotiate conditions of employment which make things better for their current, employed members by making it harder for the unemployed to get jobs. One way to do this is through the minimum wage which disproportionately affects unskilled and young, inexperienced workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When minimum wages are instituted, it removes any justification for hiring new workers at a rate not justified by that worker's productivity. On the other hand, some of the company's unionized workforce will not have the required productivity levels, meaning that the cost of sustaining these unproductive jobs will be passed on to consumers. This is because unions have also negotiated for themselves obstacles to firing their members.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 You would think that this anti-competitive behavior would be enough but it gets worse. South Africa has a state that plays a big role in the economy through government procurement as well as state-owned enterprises. Being allied with the government means that this is one more area where unions have influence.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We are seeing this play out with Eskom. The government, through the President, announced a planned restructuring of the company in which it would be split into three parts. The biggest unions operating within Eskom opposed this as a step towards privatization and possible job losses. Soon after the announcement, Eskom started stage 4 load-shedding. The government 'clarified' that no retrenchments would result from the planned restructuring and coincidentally, the load-shedding stopped.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not to say that unions had any role in precipitating the blackouts but their firm opposition to retrenchments at all costs means that what they are really saying is that the rest of the country, including poor and unemployed South Africans, should pay higher electricity prices if necessary, if that's what it takes to save their members' jobs. It is not so much that they would make this rationally self-interested call, rather it is that they have more influence than you or I in making it. Lobbying for the poor is bad for business, they tend not to pay monthly membership dues.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The 2014 Rule of Law Index report has this to say about the importance of the rule of law to a country\'92s business environment:
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Imagine an investor seeking to commit resources abroad. She would probably think twice before investing in a country where corruption is rampant, property rights are ill-defined, and contracts are difficult to enforce. Uneven enforcement of regulations, corruption, insecure property rights and ineffective means to settle disputes undermine legitimate business and drives away both domestic and foreign investment.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What this makes clear is that the rule of law is a necessary prerequisite for economic progress. An essential component of the rule of law is the existence of impartial courts where disputes are resolved fairly without favoritism to one of the parties. This is important for the economic welfare of individuals in a country because no modern economy can survive without individual property rights or contracts.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The World Economic Forum\'92s (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report seeks to measure the impartiality of courts in different countries. Through their executive survey, the data is collected and then used as one of the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) report\'92s component variables.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I have done a regression analysis to determine the five most important components of the EFW in bringing about short-term (1 year) growth in the per capita GDP. It turns out that the impartial courts variable mentioned above is one of these. I found that maximizing a country\'92s score on this sub-component could add as much as 0.37 percentage points to GDP per capita growth. This is hardly surprising.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Countries with courts that are subject to political persuasion are likely to prove inadequate in protecting private property against malicious government officials. In Zimbabwe, many white farmers appealed to the courts after their property had been seized by military veterans but law enforcement turned a blind eye, the courts were politically partial, and economic ruin soon followed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa has done relatively well, ranking 34th in the world in terms of this sub-component. Given this country\'92s urgent need to grow the economy, create wealth and get people out of poverty, the government should be aiming to take top spot in the world. Our current variable score is 5.45, while Finland, the top-ranked country, scores 7.98.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s possible for us to have the highest score in the world if, for instance, we aim at depoliticizing our judicial selection process as much as possible. While we have a reasonably high score relative to the continent (ranked 4th in Africa after Rwanda, Mauritius and Namibia), the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) process still has some political bias built-in due to the nature of the interview process. Another possible reform would be to require political parties to nominate legal professionals of suitable experience to serve on this crucial body rather than politicians.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Looking at the Finnish Judicial Appointments Board (JAB), their equivalent of our JSC is made up of members of the judiciary (seven representing the different types of Finnish courts), one advocate nominated by the bar association, one prosecutor nominated by the Prosecutor General, and one legal academic. In contrast, South Africa\'92s JSC is made up of three members of the judiciary, two advocates, two attorneys, one professor of law, ten nominees from Parliament, and five nominees from the President which includes the Minister of Justice.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In other words, our twenty-three membered JSC has more political appointees (fifteen) than professional and academic appointments (eight). Finland\'92s JAB is made up entirely of members of the judiciary, legal professionals, and a legal academic. This is something South Africa should learn from the Finns.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Making our courts impartial will not only help with growing the economy and raising living standards, but it will also go a long way in dealing with corruption. Of course, making our courts impartial, on its own, will not ensure the rule of law but given the importance of the rule of law in the economy, this would be as good a place to start as any.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Introduction
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb60\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Canada has been performing below expectations when it comes to turning its excellent science and technology into innovation. This is worrisome because there is ample empirical evidence of a positive relationship between scientific research, technological innovation and economic growth.[1] Canada does well in terms of science and technology outputs. It ranks 5th worldwide in the number of publications per thousand inhabitants, 6th for research impact and 11th in the share of patents filed at three major patent offices, known as triadic patents (Council of Canadian Academies 2018; OECD 2014). But both gross domestic expenditure on research and development and business expenditure on research and development as percentages of gross domestic product are declining (OECD 2017). Canada\'92s ranking in innovation is also falling. Its commercialization successes are limited and the rate of cluster development is low (Canada 2016; Schwab 2019). This jeopardizes the country\'92s ability to innovate.[2]
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In addition to having difficulty translating science and technology performance into efficient solutions and commercial successes, the country is dealing with the rapid dissemination of discontinuous and potentially disruptive technologies.[3] These include big data analytics; artificial intelligence (AI); the Internet of things; advanced materials; additive manufacturing such as 3D printing; and blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions duplicated and distributed across a computer network. These technologies are drastically changing the way firms are designing, prototyping, testing and manufacturing new products and services. As Daniele Archibugi wrote in 2017: \'93One of the key characteristics of disruptive technologies is that they do not knock gently at the door: they enter social and economic life suddenly and unexpectedly\'94 (2017, 541). Clear illustrations of this phenomenon include the emergence of Uber, the exponential doubling of computer chip power and the rapid advances in DNA sequencing.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Schumpeterian creative destruction forces such as autonomous vehicles, personalized medicine and the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial processes using smart technology are forcing businesses and public organizations to rethink how they generate ideas and innovate. Governments are also under pressure to provide better adapted regulation and innovation policies. Given their slow rates of technology adoption, most Canadian firms appear ill equipped to overcome the challenges that stem from these technologies. Canada\'92s innovation policy framework needs to be redesigned to accommodate new ways of organizing and governing innovation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Innovation Superclusters Initiative, which was put forward by the federal government in 2017, is the centrepiece of its plan to resolve Canada\'92s innovation paradox (Canada 2017b). Under this initiative, Ottawa is investing $950 million over five years to support five superclusters involving small, medium-sized and large companies, academic institutions and not-for-profit organizations. Each supercluster has its own focus: digital technologies, protein industries, next-generation manufacturing, supply chains powered by AI, and ocean technologies. The government says its aim is to promote commercial innovation and global presence, from ideation to value creation, while providing the means to organize innovation ecosystems to collectively face and benefit from groundbreaking technologies.[4] The objectives of the initiative are quite ambitious. The superclusters are expected to increase business spending on research and development, promote widespread collaboration, attract and retain the right talent, and increase the size and global reach of firms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Increasing domestic firms\'92 size and reach, also called scaling up, has been a top priority for decades for most countries. Yet Canada still fails to produce multinationals. Repeatedly hammering the same \'93scaling up\'94 nail has not provided the expected benefits. It is time to try something else. We at the Partnership for the Organisation of Innovation and New Technologies hypothesize that the advantages accrued from collectively developing and commercializing innovations within ecosystems may counterbalance the extent of scaling up required, or expected, of firms to succeed. The superclusters initiative might prove that well-organized innovation ecosystems provide the necessary agility and performance to become engines of economic growth and wealth creation in the country. Working together could yield a collective performance that is larger than the sum of its parts, a win-win situation for the ecosystem and its constituents. In our view, the concept of innovation ecosystems provides the appropriate framework to rethink Canada\'92s innovation strategy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Even though the name of the initiative includes the word \'93cluster\'94, the superclusters are in fact more akin to innovation ecosystems. Unlike clusters, they are not locally or geographically constrained, and many of their constituent members are part of extensive networks of national and international firms or organizations. The concept of ecosystem, and more specifically of innovation ecosystem, is increasingly used by academics, practitioners and policy-makers. It provides a new lens for studying and understanding innovation that goes beyond clusters or networks. However, the concept is still not well defined and understood. And the empirical tools to measure its broad impact have yet to be designed. In this study, we briefly survey the relevant literature on clusters and superclusters, or innovation ecosystems, to examine the theoretical and empirical foundations that underlie the government\'92s initiative. We then explore the challenges and opportunities presented by this novel policy approach.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Building Blocks of Innovation Ecosystems
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While the concept of an innovation ecosystem was inspired by ecology, its foundations within the economics and management sciences derive from numerous strands of the literature that study and describe the way individuals and organizations interact and collaborate formally and informally. The theoretical foundations of the concept span industrial clusters, knowledge networks, geographic, social and cognitive proximities, collaboration and open innovation \'97 all of which have been shown to have a positive impact on a firm\'92s propensity to innovate. To fully understand why and how innovation ecosystems have the potential to boost Canada\'92s innovation capacity, it is important to understand the foundations on which they are built.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Industrial clusters
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There has long been a strong interest in clusters within the scientific community and among policy-makers. Since Michael Porter introduced the idea of clusters in 1990, few economic concepts have provoked such enthusiasm. Still, the benefits of clustering were studied long before Porter\'92s seminal work. He drew on the work of Alfred Marshall who, in his 1890 book Principles of Economics, emphasized the importance and advantages of geographical proximity for economic growth in reducing transportation and other transaction costs. Porter initially defined an industrial cluster as a group of geographically colocated, interconnected firms and organizations within a sector that share common elements and are complementary to each other. Silicon Valley is a well-known and envied example of a highly efficient and productive cluster. Other names have been given to this local concentration of enterprises, skills, cooperation and competition, including regional systems of innovation (Lundvall 1992), flexible specialization (Piore and Sabel 1984), smart specialization (Foray 2014) and industrial districts (Beccatini 1990). These concepts all focus on the importance of geographical proximity, which allows trust-building among stakeholders and access to a highly specialized labour force.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Research has shown that firms that operate in clusters are more innovative than firms that operate in isolation. They generate more patents and have greater employment and revenue growth, partly due to specialization or diversification effects.[5] The presence of strong research universities as integral parts of clusters increases the propensity of small, local firms to patent and that of universities to coevolve along with local, private sector patenting (Helmers and Rogers 2015; Blankenberg and Buenstorf 2016). Silicon Valley would not be the same without the fundamental role played by Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley. Researchers and students created spinoffs and start-ups, and went back and forth between private enterprises and the universities.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The better performance of firms located in clusters is generally attributed to the geographical proximity that defines them. Reducing the distance of interactions improves coordination between members of the cluster and facilitates the sharing of tacit knowledge gained through experience or shared expertise (Bathelt and Cohendet 2014; Gertler 2003). But geographical proximity is by no means essential when knowledge is exchanged more formally (Bathelt and Henn 2014). In other words, clusters are not a universal panacea.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since Porter\'92s seminal work, interpretations of the concept of \'93cluster\'94 have multiplied and evolved to incorporate other types of proximity. The literature has shown that the degree of geographical proximity varies across local systems of innovation, or innovation clusters.[6] Table 1 portrays a four-quadrant framework for clusters. It was developed by Andr\'e9 Torre in his 2006 work Clusters et syst\'e8mes locaux d\'92innovation. This framework helps us analyze two crucial dimensions of innovation clusters: the degree of colocalization or geographical proximity and the degree of organization of interfirm links or organizational proximity. The latter refers to the capacity to coordinate the transfer and exchange of information and knowledge either within or between organizations (Boschma 2005). Establishments within the same firm that share a common organizational culture are more likely to have strong links. So too do firms that share a common knowledge space and have developed formal collaborative agreements. This conceptual framework can be used to compare clusters and innovation ecosystems, as it shows there are various ways to organize both.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Quadrant 1 represents clusters as defined by Porter. They rely to a significant degree on colocation and strong organizational ties. Emerging clusters very likely start this way, with strong relationships between a few local actors. They are often the result of a specific regional policy to create a cluster. Silicon Valley fits in this category. Quadrant 2 illustrates the case of clusters with weak local anchoring and strong interfirm relations. These clusters can exist at a national and regional level. They are more akin to knowledge or innovation networks. The development and production of Airbus aircraft, which spans the European continent and other countries, is a clear example. Airbus has plants in China, France, Germany, Spain and the United States. Yet interfirm relations are strong. Quadrant 3 shows the third type of cluster, characterized by a high spatial concentration of firms but weak interfirm links where knowledge is exchanged more formally. Synergy in this case can be encouraged through various national policies, for example by bringing together firms that may benefit from fiscal incentives to colocate their research and development activities in a science park. This type of incentive gave rise to the strong electronic games industry in Montreal. Over time, interactions between individuals often lead to more organized links between firms in these clusters. Quadrant 4 is not considered to be a type of cluster because it lacks both geographical and organizational proximity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The measured impact of clusters depends on the type of cluster being considered as well as the precision and level of aggregation of the indicators used to gauge this impact (Beaudry and Schiffauerova 2009). Performance indicators commonly found in the literature include the propensity to innovate and the number of innovations; the number of patents and their citation-based quality or value; and employment and revenue growth. There is a need to better define and assess these indicators. They are measured either at the firm level, to assess the performance of firms within clusters compared to more isolated firms, or at the cluster level, to examine the overall performance of the organizations therein. Rarely are both levels examined jointly to assess the extent to which the arrangement is a win-win for the firm and the cluster. This is something that the ecosystem framework enables.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Although some view geographical proximity as an advantage in facilitating collaboration, it is neither sufficient nor necessary for successful collaboration. Collaboration can be coordinated at a distance through temporary proximity (Torre 2008), for instance short trips of a few days to a few weeks or months for the team to meet face to face. Researchers have also come to recognize the importance of cognitive and social proximity for the success of ecosystems. Cognitive proximity measures the degree to which individuals or organizations share a common knowledge base. Social proximity refers to how socially close individuals are, or how well they know each other and interact. Several researchers argue that cognitive proximity is the principal cause of tacit knowledge spillovers from one firm to another (Breschi and Lissoni 2001). This can happen regardless of whether the firms are colocated or geographically dispersed within a community that shares a common knowledge base. For more efficient knowledge transmission (Agrawal, Kapur and McHale 2008), however, a degree of social proximity is also required, that is, strong trust relations between actors based on friendship, kinship and experience (Boschma 2005).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Coherent and efficient coordination of innovation can take place at the subnational level, such as in the provinces, territories or smaller regions in Canada. Yet national and international links to other organizations are often beneficial to the innovation process (Walshok, Shapiro and Owens 2014). To fully understand innovation ecosystems, we must consider another layer of links and relationships beyond geographically bound clusters. The literature on knowledge networks provides this second building block.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Knowledge networks
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The literature on innovation ecosystems often refers to the networking aspects of the relationships (the links of the networks) between actors (the nodes of the networks), which are not necessarily geographically bound as is often assumed in the cluster literature (figure 1). Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien describe ecosystems as being \'93formed of large, loosely connected networks of entities\'94 (2004 35). Erik Den Hartigh, Michiel Tol and Wouter Visscher describe them as consisting of \'93a network of actors around a core technology, who depend on each other for their success and survival\'94 (2006, 2). The geographical proximity of actors is rarely considered in this literature.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Organizations, units within organizations and individuals that occupy a key network position are generally more productive and innovative.[7] This can be a function of how highly connected (or central) these individuals and organizations are within the network and whether their collaborators are interconnected (form a close-knit community). For example, firms that collaborate with multiple university teams, collaborate with both suppliers and clients to codevelop technologies, and use technologies from several providers are considered technology integrators. They occupy central positions in their respective networks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In highly interconnected or dense networks, knowledge and information travels relatively fast. This facilitates knowledge sharing. Basic science networks are predominantly highly dense networks (Wagner 2018), where access to the opposite side of the networks requires only a few handshakes. The individuals and organizations that link different parts of a network that would otherwise be disjointed (see nodes highlighted in figure 1), often bridge the gaps between communities, sectors, disciplines or industries. Burt refers to such gaps as structural holes (1992). The firms and researchers that first combined biology, computer science and information engineering to create the bioinformatics interdisciplinary field occupied such intermediary positions in their network (Freeman 1977). Since innovation often stems from the new combination of existing knowledge, these intermediaries play an important role.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the other end of the spectrum in terms of network structure are less dense or sparser networks. An example is shown in figure 2. Such networks are characteristic of applied science fields and most innovation networks. As a technology matures, moves toward market application and transforms into product innovation, firms require fewer collaborators with which they have strong relationships, and they distance themselves from governments and universities. That is not say that they completely isolate themselves from centres of science and knowledge generation, but the latter are no longer in the immediate network surroundings of the firm for the technology in question.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As such, innovation ecosystems and the superclusters are networks built to integrate different strong science communities, well-integrated sectors and supply chains, as well as other organizations and firms interested in the use of common key technologies. We therefore expect to find that the networks of members and researchers within the superclusters are relatively sparse, with dense clusters of nodes united by structural holes occupied by innovative individuals or organizations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is an ongoing debate in the literature about which type of knowledge network, dense or sparse, is more conducive to innovation. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. A dense network can facilitate close collaboration but may be impervious to outside innovation. A sparse network, with its structural holes, can contribute to the creative process by combining ideas from diverse sectors. But it may lack the capacity for intensive collaboration. Both models can be complementary within a sparser network structure, however. Pockets of dense, closely linked communities connected by one or more structural holes can create strong ties among members and intersectoral exchanges that are beneficial to knowledge exchange, idea generation and exploration (Wang 2016), as well as innovation (Rost 2011).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The literature on knowledge networks is neither abundant nor conclusive regarding their role in generating innovation in the case of the specific disruptive technologies[8] at the heart of the Innovation Superclusters Initiative. It remains to be seen whether the players developing these technologies will be able to successfully establish strong links with organizations using other technologies or with other sectors within the superclusters. Will the individuals and organizations expected to occupy structural holes between technologies, and between new and more traditional sectors, foster the recombination of knowledge necessary to accelerate innovation?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Beyond their structure, the strength of network links is also important (Baum, Cowan and Jonard 2014). Informal relationships and collaborations, such as social ties, participation in associations and their events, trade fairs and international community gatherings, and even knowledge trading, play a crucial role in catalyzing knowledge within innovation ecosystems as well as in open innovation (Henkel, Sch\'f6berl and Alexy 2014; West et al., 2014). These informal ties, which are implicit in the cluster literature and are formally acknowledged but considered difficult to measure in the network literature, are what make innovation ecosystems work. This is particularly important in the case of disruptive technologies, where problem solving requires more extensive collaboration and a certain degree of openness. As AnnaLee Saxenian pointed out, Silicon Valley engineers who once worked together remained in contact after moving firms and often interacted formally and informally to exchange information and solve technological problems (1994). Social, organizational and cognitive proximity between individuals was crucial to the rise and maintenance of the Silicon Valley advantage. This collaboration culture blurred the boundaries of firms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Collaboration
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If innovation clusters and knowledge networks are the building blocks of innovation ecosystems, collaboration is the glue that brings both concepts together. Collaboration within and between organizations or sectors acts as a catalyst. It accelerates the sharing of information, skills and resources; improves the generation, valuation and validation of ideas; increases the capacity of organizations to innovate; and spans disciplines, organizations, sectors and users.[9] Firms that collaborate with their clients, suppliers and universities are generally more innovative. Firms are often located close to their clients or to their suppliers, but that does not necessarily mean they collaborate with them. Collaboration can occur across different types of proximity, be it geographical, cognitive or social, and at different stages of the innovation value chain, such as at the knowledge, ideas or project stage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The challenges posed by discontinuous and potentially disruptive technologies will demand broader intersectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration from firms seeking to benefit from such changes. The speed at which these technologies impose themselves on the market will force the codevelopment of new innovation practices, policies and regulation involving all stakeholders. It is therefore imperative to rethink the roles of and collaborative relationships between policy-makers, decision-makers, experts, academics and final users.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For instance, universities and other contributors to science and technology are expected to help develop new technologies and commercialize the fruits of their research through mechanisms such as technology transfers, licensing and the creation of spinoffs, or with the help of the private sector (Breznitz and Feldman 2012). In particular, research collaboration between the private and public sectors is seen as essential, which is why university-industry links have become an integral part of the university funding landscape (Goldfarb 2008). The nature, process and value of the resulting innovations are well documented (OECD 2015). Far from being detrimental to science, university-industry links lead to research that has more impact (Lebeau et al. 2008). This raises the question of Canada\'92s poor performance in this regard. University-industry links that bridge the gaps between knowledge, technology and innovation[10] were expected to be the key to improving Canada\'92s innovation performance. The results have been disappointing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Innovation Ecosystems as a Metaphor
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The concept of innovation ecosystems draws broadly on the literature and research investigating the benefits of innovation clusters, various types of proximities, knowledge networks and collaboration. Because innovation clusters and knowledge networks are known to have a positive influence on innovation, we expect that organizations involved in strong innovation ecosystems should also be more innovative (Adner 2006).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The economist Michael Rothschild was the first to use the term \'93ecosystem\'94 as a metaphor in the economics and management of innovation literature. His 1990 book, Bionomics: Economy as Ecosystem, inspired James Moore to describe firms and their networks as business ecosystems. \'93In a business ecosystem, companies coevolve capabilities around a new innovation: they work cooperatively and competitively to support new products, satisfy customer needs, and eventually incorporate the next round of innovation\'94 (Moore 1993, 76). By transposing the notion of the biological ecosystem to the economy, he also redefined the economic system as an ecosystem where organizations and consumers represent living organisms intertwined in mutually dependent relationships (Moore 1996).[11]
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Business ecosystems include small and large businesses, universities, research centres and public sector organizations and tend to position themselves around a leading company (Peltoniemi 2005). Such ecosystems may include a company\'92s competitors as well as its customers, whose behaviour is likely to influence the company\'92s performance. The diversity of the actors involved is partly attributable to the digital transformation of several industrial sectors. It also reflects the convergence of a variety of technologies and industries, such as 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  in precision medicine, industrial Internet of things in aerospace, 3D printing in health, and AI in mobility services. By coevolving their skills, the various organizations that constitute the business ecosystem create value for their customers (Moore 1996). The term \'93ecosystem\'94 emphasizes the crucial role of networking and the participation of varied actors in the innovation process (Smorodinskaya et al. 2017).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The concept of business ecosystem focuses on the firm and its network. Some researchers built on this concept as they examined the way firms were using external as well as internal resources in the innovation process. This led to the notion of innovation ecosystems and of open innovation ecosystems (Adner 2006; Rohrbeck, H\'f6lzle and Gem\'fcnden 2009). Open innovation provides key insights on how innovation ecosystems work and perform.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Open innovation
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Collaboration, cooperation and open innovation are of paramount importance to well-functioning ecosystems. This was implied in the cluster literature and formally measured in the literature on knowledge networks. Many firms had already adopted at least some forms of open innovation before the concept was first described by Henry Chesbrough in his 2003 book, Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology. Indeed, since the 1970s, research and development is no longer performed entirely within the firm. The locus of innovation has migrated out of a company and into the value network to which it belongs (Brandenburger and Nalebuff 1996). The value network has replaced the concept of value chain because products and services have become dematerialized and the value chain no longer has a purely physical dimension. In value networks, value is cocreated by a combination of players in the network. This compels a degree of open innovation, defined as \'93the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and to expand the markets for external use of innovation respectively\'94 (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke and West 2006).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Open innovation encompasses three main groups of activities: inbound activities, outbound activities and a mixture of the two generally referred to as coupled activities.[12] An organization undertakes inbound activities when it mobilizes external resources and knowledge acquired, for example, through licensing or crowd-sourcing. Firms with greater market knowledge may acquire new innovations in order to sell them to other organizations. Outbound activities refer to the external use and exploitation of internal knowledge. Such activities consist of transferring knowledge and the results of internal research and development to external partners for them to commercialize. For example, a firm could benefit from selling or granting access to some of its intellectual property to a company that has a business model better suited to the commercialization of that technology. A company may also decide to externalize the commercialization of internal knowledge when the latter does not match its strategic objectives. This can generate revenues from technologies, goods or services that would otherwise have remained on the shelf. Coupled activities are a combination of the first two, where sharing complementary resources among partners can lead to critical innovation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As the previous paragraph suggests, open innovation does not necessarily involve collaboration. A firm may, for instance, find an external path to market for a technology that it does not want or need to commercialize itself. Conversely, firms may contract out research and development activities or obtain a licence for patented technologies without signing a collaborative agreement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With open innovation, innovation is no longer confined to the boundaries of a firm. It is developed at least partly outside the organization with other firms, governments or universities. Many factors contributed to this change in the way organizations innovate, among them the increasing complexity and cost of research and development, and accelerated technological change. Opening to other organizations allows firms to break down silos, acquire more resources, reduce risk and share knowledge and resources.[13] Linear and closed innovation processes, as well as traditional business models, have evolved toward more open and interactive structures, where informal links adjoin formal relationships (Cohendet and Simon 2017; Autio and Thomas 2014). The concept of open innovation perfectly complements the literature on clusters and networks in characterizing the links between different types of organizations within innovation ecosystems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ecosystem diversity
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Open innovation underscores the importance of collaboration between diverse stakeholders, each of whom contributes to innovation in its own way. Within innovation ecosystems, the focus of analysis is on the interactions between interdependent actors whose objective is to create and market innovations benefiting the end user. While business ecosystem studies concentrate on the firm and its environment, innovation ecosystem studies focus on innovation and the constellation of actors that support it.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 An organization can be involved in various ecosystems (knowledge, innovation or business ecosystems) and play a different role in each (Valkokari 2015). Similarly, while the same set of diverse actors from different sectors, businesses, universities or government institutions may populate business and innovation ecosystems, their role and importance differ from one ecosystem to another. A firm can be the leader of an ecosystem, but leadership can also fall to another type of organization, such as a university or a government entity. Relationships are not strictly hierarchical among ecosystem members but rather collaborative. This makes network literature useful when studying these interorganization links.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The core of business ecosystems consists of firms, suppliers, consumers and distributors. Other organizations are only weakly involved. In contrast, innovation ecosystems are characterized by the importance of research institutions, local intermediaries and policy-makers. They include participants from outside the traditional value chain (Valkokari 2015). These can be customers, universities that provide science and technology, regulators, innovation coordinators or intermediaries, and firms that coevolve with the ecosystem, often in symbiotic relationships (Mazzucato and Robinson 2017).These participants are often geographically concentrated, which is why the cluster literature remains relevant in studying innovation ecosystems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Silicon Valley clearly functions as an innovation ecosystem. While governments have tried to imitate or reproduce Silicon Valley, few have succeeded by adopting a simple cluster approach. With the superclusters initiative, deliberately anchored in Canada\'92s technological, sectoral and economic strengths, Ottawa is experimenting with something different. It is trying to encourage intersectoral collaboration, which does not come naturally to most firms.[14]
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Innovation Ecosystems in Practice \'97 the Canadian Superclusters
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to the government\'92s program overview, the Innovation Superclusters Initiative is meant to encourage the establishment of \'93large-scale industry partnerships, supported by other innovation ecosystems players.\'94 Aspiring superclusters were asked \'93to work together on ambitious market-driven proposals to supercharge their regional innovation ecosystems, enhancing the growth and competitiveness of participating firms and maximizing economic benefits, including good, well-
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 paying jobs and prosperity for Canada\'94 (Canada 2017a). A key objective is to promote widespread wealth creation through the adoption of new and potentially disruptive technologies within innovation ecosystems, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This bold approach aims to reverse Canada\'92s deteriorating innovation performance, accelerate the adoption by Canadian firms of several key transformative technologies and foster a strong entrepreneurial or start-up culture. The government hopes that by facilitating the involvement of all stakeholders in the superclusters, bottlenecks such as the snakes-and-ladders game between regulation and innovation and other difficulties in translating science and technology into successful products can be overcome. Under the initiative, universities, government laboratories, innovation intermediaries and firms of all sizes are having to work together to develop a functional governance structure for these very large innovation ecosystems. This is expected to help flag problems along the innovation value chain and create the climate of trust necessary for greater collaboration among different disciplines and sectors.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 More generally, promoting the emergence of strong innovation ecosystems that span several sectors, even beyond those involved in the superclusters initiative, has the potential to strengthen Canada\'92s innovation capacity and competitiveness. The literature surveyed in this article certainly hints at the potential benefits of innovation superclusters, although their true economic impact has yet to be accurately measured. Learning from the experience of the innovation superclusters and that of other innovation ecosystems is timely and crucial for the Canadian economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Despite their names, the five superclusters are centred on technologies rather than industrial sectors. These are detailed in box 1. While all superclusters have a strong local base, they span several regions of the country, building on numerous strong, local technology hubs. The concept of innovation ecosystem is the appropriate framework to study the supercluster initiative but, as we have shown, it is a concept that encompasses several others. No single strand of the literature can fully describe the ways in which the superclusters initiative can help reverse Canada\'92s downward innovation spiral, nor how it can become a successful Canadian innovation in and of itself. The lens needed to understand how the superclusters operate, to measure whether they achieve their goals and to evaluate their performance does not yet exist. More research is needed to equip organizational actors with a comprehensive conceptual framework and the appropriate indicators and decision-making tools to bring about the necessary transformations.[15]
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Key performance indicators: Measuring what matters
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The initial program guide provided to applicants wishing to take part in the superclusters initiative included four clearly stated objectives and a list of seven key performance indicators to measure expected outcomes over the life of the program. These are detailed in box 2. This signalled the government\'92s intention to monitor the impact of its investment. Although they broadly cover the main goals of the initiative, the initial key performance indicators consist mainly of generic indicators that, in our view, overemphasize basic metrics such as the number of collaborative projects, participating companies and organizations, and the number of jobs created in small and medium-sized enterprises. These provide a good starting point to measure results, but are too simplistic to gauge the full impact of the superclusters initiative on innovation and collaboration. Since the initiative was launched, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has been consulting with experts and working with members of the five superclusters to develop a more detailed and precise set of indicators. Some of these are included in box 3. [16]
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The first group of key performance indicators in box 3 underline the need to boost investment in industrial research and development. Business enterprise research and development has been chronically below par in this country. Canada has been falling behind other OECD countries on this indicator for more than a decade (CCA 2018). The revised indicators are an improvement on the initial indicators proposed by recognizing the importance of investing in demonstration and commercialization activities, which often become increasingly costly as the technology moves toward the market. It will be important to track whether and where these investments take place.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 More generally, the updated performance indicators are directly aligned with the government\'92s strategy to advance business-led innovation and technology leadership activities, and to boost productivity, performance and competitiveness. The dollar value of such investments provides a strong indication of business commitment to innovate, but we also need to be able to monitor how the superclusters go about implementing the necessary changes. Boosting a firm\'92s productivity, performance and competitiveness requires putting together the best teams and mobilizing the right set of resources to foster innovation. The former requirement can be gauged in part by the number of science and technology professionals participating in supercluster activities, the number of jobs created and the rate of employment growth in small and medium-sized enterprises. Whether the right set of resources has been assembled can be measured by the outcomes: the number of products and processes developed, improved and commercialized.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The third set of indicators also includes the number of patents or copyrights. This is an important addition to the list because, in some cases, the technologies being promoted by the superclusters are at a relatively embryonic stage of development. It is likely that some of the most ambitious projects will only reach a relatively early stage of technology maturity by the end of the five-year program. Having an interim indicator, such as the number of patents and copyrights, will provide an idea of the innovation potential of the supercluster.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Translating investment in research and development into innovation is a necessary step to improving economic growth. Yet the actual economic impact of these activities in terms of increases in revenue, market share or exports was absent from the government\'92s initial list of indicators, although such indicators are included in the strategic plans of most superclusters. They are now on the government\'92s list, focusing on two elements: increases in contributions to gross domestic product and in the share of small and medium-sized enterprises that export goods or services. This definition of wealth creation, however, is considerably narrower than the aggregate economic, social and environmental benefits contemplated by the Council of Canadian Academies in its 2018 report. Canadians expect government investments in innovation to lead to improved quality of life, pollution reduction, health improvements and poverty reduction. Ultimately, these are the types of outcomes that we should be measuring. But it is notoriously difficult to do so.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The idea behind the second set of key performance indicators is that more collaboration between private, academic and public sector organizations will improve the country\'92s commercialization performance. The extent of university-industry collaboration is used as an input indicator in the innovation literature and by the World Economic Forum.[17] But simply counting the number of collaborative projects will not be conducive to large-scale collaboration and may even be counterproductive as it encourages a multiplicity of small projects. Having an excessive number of small projects or larger projects broken down into smaller ones to meet performance indicator requirements will make it more difficult to coordinate and to measure the overall impact. These biases may be partially counterbalanced by also counting the number of member organizations involved in each project, although this is more suitable for larger or more important projects. And, while these metrics may be indicators of scale and potential reach, they fail to convey any information about the quality of the links and relationships within the ecosystem or how productive they are in terms of outcomes. Indicators aimed at characterizing these relationships should be developed to monitor progress over the course of the initiative. Finding ways to measure the benefits of collaboration would be a further challenge, but it would help offset potential biases linked to simple project counts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The expanded set of indicators emphasizes innovation ecosystems\'92 growth, monitoring employment growth in participating small and medium-sized enterprises and the number of new jobs created overall. Tracking the number of new firms created and the number of high-growth firms involved in the supercluster is consistent with the scale-up objective. Some caution is warranted, however. Beyond the desired spinoffs, start-ups and gazelles alluded to in the government\'92s objectives, many of the high-growth firms that will be added to the count likely already belong to existing sectors. Many of the so-called new employees come from somewhere else. Although this is not a zero-sum game, employees who leave their current employment to move to small and medium-sized firms involved in the superclusters will deplete firms, sectors, regions and ecosystems elsewhere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The inevitable but beneficial workforce mobility involved in the innovation process should be taken into account. For example, when an aerospace firm is developing a new aircraft, its workforce is likely to decrease if demand is declining for its older aircraft models. Yet this is often the most innovative period for the company. Simply counting the number of employees, or employment growth, will not reflect the firm\'92s innovative capacity embodied in its employees. We suggest that measures of the quality and innovative capacity of human capital in relation to the stage of development of the technology be added to the indicator list. Existing innovation surveys already gather information on the number of employees with technical, science and engineering degrees, PhDs, or those devoted to research and development or tasks related to commercialization. A culture that encourages employees to innovate is an important contributor to the innovation process. Mercan and Goktas (2011) used elements of the Global Innovation Index developed by the World Economic Forum and INSEAD, a graduate business school (Schwab 2019), to measure innovation culture. With the power of big data analytics at our fingertips, we can go one step further and account for the experience employees have had in past projects and their involvement in successful innovations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Given the government\'92s focus on technologies rather than sectors in designing the superclusters program, an important missing performance indicator relates to the transfer and adoption of technologies by firms and organizations in sectors other than those that produce them. As shown in box 1, there is a particular focus on promoting the adoption of digital technologies and AI by Canadian firms. How transformative these technologies will be for the firms that adopt them will need to be assessed. Successful adoption is likely to occur through informal relationships and the sharing of tacit knowledge, which are difficult to measure. It is the key to greater competitive advantage and wealth creation for the adopting firms and organizations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The contribution of innovation ecosystems to economic growth, competitiveness and wealth creation cannot simply be measured in terms of the number of new products or processes or increases in exports, productivity and gross domestic product. Some of the superclusters such as NGen, the supercluster focused on next- generation manufacturing, have adopted more extensive performance \'adindicators. Yet their overall approach is the same as that of the government.[18] Such indicators may be easier to quantify, but they are at best proxies for innovation and its impact. Ultimately, the government and the superclusters will need to develop more sophisticated indicators to truly measure the potential and the impact of innovation ecosystems. This will enable stakeholders to adapt innovation practices and policies to provide a win-win environment for the ecosystems and their constituent organizations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Supporting effective innovation ecosystems: Addressing knowledge gaps
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Innovation Supercluster Initiative provides a unique opportunity to advance knowledge about superclusters beyond a few simple metrics aimed at demonstrating value for the public investment. Gaining a better understanding of supercluster dynamics would benefit not only policy-makers but all stakeholders. Indeed, the supercluster initiative should be viewed as somewhat of a Canadian experiment. Identifying the factors that facilitate the emergence and success of these superclusters and other ecosystems will help policy-makers better design and fine-tune innovation policies and programs. The timing is certainly propitious. Having mobilized their communities around specific technologies or sectors, groups that applied but were not chosen to become superclusters in 2017 have tried to maintain momentum by setting up more formal governance structures and accessing various government programs. Identifying and measuring the commonalities and divergences of other innovation ecosystems as they emerge would help governments target the right policies to foster their success.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We urgently need to design and test new metrics adapted to the reality of innovation ecosystems. The tools currently at our disposal provide measurements that are at best proxies for true innovation potential. We need indicators that accurately reflect the complex dynamics of collaborating across provinces, sectors and organizations on the digital transformation of traditional sectors while making the most of the discontinuous and potentially disruptive technologies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is still much we need to learn. For instance, the way in which innovation ecosystems emerge, adapt to paradigm shifts brought about by new disruptive technologies, and bridge the gap between science and technology and the commercialization of innovation is still poorly understood. Ecosystems are not static. They evolve as innovations develop. It is therefore important to identify the characteristics and similarities of different types of innovation ecosystems at different points in their life cycle. This includes their contribution to and impact on the generation and conversion of ideas and on the commercialization and implementation of innovation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We do not yet know how to assess the different governance structures that span informal and formal relationships within innovation ecosystems. To ensure that the superclusters and other innovation ecosystems operate efficiently requires a deeper understanding of the organizations and individuals at the core of these networks and the specific roles they play as the convenors or facilitators of their ecosystems. There are numerous examples of successful governance structures, shared intellectual property and trust-based collaborative groups in Canada. But they are often well-guarded secrets. The Consortium de recherche et d\'92innovation en a\'e9rospatiale au Qu\'e9bec (CRIAQ) is one example. Under the CRIAQ contract between universities and aerospace firms, all prior intellectual property is declared and new intellectual property is shared among the industrial partners, without preventing academics from conducting further research on the subject. This model has existed for several years and has contributed to enhancing Quebec\'92s aerospace innovation performance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A crucial task is to accurately gauge the win-win conditions for both individual organizations and ecosystems. It would be counterproductive to adopt key performance indicators at the level of the individual organization, whether it is a firm, university, government organization or innovation intermediary, that are incompatible with those at the level of the innovation ecosystem. A minimum degree of coherence is necessary to ensure the success of well-organized innovation ecosystems. That raises questions. How much self-organization or self-governance do ecosystem members require as opposed to, or in addition to, a more top-down approach? How loose or formalized should the decision-making process be within the ecosystem? How should its convenors oversee decision-making to foster innovation? In the case of the superclusters, a strong sectoral governance structure may dominate and impose itself, but it may not produce the expected innovation boost.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Developing new and validated key performance indicators for innovation ecosystems is one of the main goals of the Partnership for the Organisation of Innovation and New Technologies. Although the scope of our project is broader than measuring the impact of the superclusters, our research community has much to learn from innovation ecosystem dynamics and the success factors underlying their performance. The superclusters initiative provides fertile ground to test new ways to assess industrial and ecosystem performance and to compare those results with more traditional metrics such as those mentioned in boxes 2 and 3. It is encouraging that the department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development wishes to remain at the forefront of new research and is open to developing news ways to measure the impact of its supercluster program. It has been a partner of our organization since the beginning and is codeveloping with us these new indicators of ecosystem innovation and performance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Challenges for Innovation Ecosystems and the Superclusters
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Canada, we are still looking for the recipe to scale up firms. How to scale up ecosystems is an even greater challenge. We know, for instance, that stakeholders take part in ecosystems because they see an opportunity to resolve issues and develop market opportunities. Firms scale up when their market expands locally or \'adinternationally. Ecosystems should help in that regard. However, multiorganization collaboration requires the integration of working practices and processes. This can be challenging, especially when multiple organizations from multiple sectors are involved. But aligning scaling up with multiorganization or sectoral collaboration is precisely where the potential advantage of innovation ecosystems and superclusters lies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A related question to be investigated is whether innovation ecosystems are agile enough to provide an alternative to the need for firms to scale up to succeed. Organizations and ecosystems are increasingly seeking to coordinate a variety of activities that were formerly scattered across diverse entities focused on different technologies. They are doing this not only to accelerate the innovation trajectory toward commercialization but also to overcome the cost pressures, technological complexity and social acceptability issues that are making innovation projects more complex. Complexity is forcing firms to collaborate. More research is needed to develop and implement new practices, platforms, roles and functions to operationalize and govern ecosystems and their member firms as they scale up. This is particularly important when multiple sectors are involved, as is the case for most superclusters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As traditional economic sectors (aerospace and manufacturing in general) look to benefit from advances in big data analytics and AI technologies, it is important to document and understand how ecosystems successfully evolve in response to the challenges brought about by these technologies. Gaining better knowledge of these new networks and collaborative spaces will contribute to the development of effective public policies and industry practices that are conducive to the sustainability of ecosystems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In this context, it is particularly important to understand the \'93modularity of technological artifacts\'94 within innovation ecosystems (Beltagui, Rosli and Candi 2020). This term refers to the degree to which the components of a technology can be separated and recombined. At the heart of the supercluster initiative is the government\'92s wish for a wide-scale digital transformation of the Canadian industrial fabric. Adoption of new digital modules within an industry or sector, such as manufacturing or health care, will disrupt traditional innovation processes and constitute a paradigm shift in all the sectors that will be affected. For instance, big data analytics is transforming the health care ecosystem by recombining specific technological and medical modules (such as AI, genomics and pharmacology), further personalizing medical treatment and fostering the emergence a new digital health ecosystem. In the manufacturing sector, 3D printing will revolutionize and shorten the product development process, displacing some of the traditional ways used to produce and assemble complex objects. The manufacturing sector will need to evolve to benefit from these new technologies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The integration of new technologies in more traditional sectors may require the use of specific creativity methods, such as design thinking, to explore how to best combine knowledge from unrelated disciplines and sectors.[19] This will likely involve other \'adstakeholders, such as users and non-experts, which adds a level of complexity. Organizations must come up with new configurations to support the development of creative ideas through both internal and external initiatives (Cohendet, Grandadam and Simon 2010). Identifying the instigators of these transformations will help trigger change in laggard sectors, clusters or ecosystems.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To fully benefit from their innovation ecosystems, individual firms will also need to adopt more open and agile business models adapted to constant ecosystem evolution (Attour and Burger-Helmchen 2014). Analyzing how sectors that have successfully adopted these advanced technologies have managed the transition would provide invaluable knowledge for other sectors and ecosystems about to experience similar transformations. Worldwide, efforts are being deployed to implement industry 4.0 (the adoption of digital technologies by manufacturing), smart cities, self-driving cars, personalized medicine and smart electric grids. What these innovations have in common is that they combine knowledge and technologies from a variety of sectors or disciplines. Their impact is also cross-cutting. For instance, industry 4.0 and its underlying technologies will not only affect the manufacturing sector, but also health, transport and agri-food. Breaking down disciplinary and sectoral silos within ecosystems will be crucial. Yet public policy and regulation are still developed in sectoral silos that struggle to adapt to these disruptive technologies. Moreover, the speed at which these radical innovations enter the market leaves decision-makers in catch-up mode. This limits the innovation potential of the country.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Canadian public policy needs to change to enable the necessary transformations within firms, universities, government and society in general. New policies are needed to support the extensive combination of knowledge that spans multiple disciplines and sectors. Regulatory harmonization for sectors such as aerospace and health, which are already undergoing a vast digital transformation, and information and communication technology is urgently needed to avoid stopping transdisciplinary and cross-industry innovation in its tracks. To take one example, the extent of data collection and the stringency of the cybersecurity required for precision medicine to fully deploy suggest a clear shift is needed in the way we address regulation. One avenue that holds promise is for governments to codevelop targeted public policies and appropriate regulations with innovation intermediaries in ecosystems. Innovation support mechanisms also have to be developed in parallel with regulation. This would provide a reinforcing policy framework where regulation is no longer seen as an obstacle to the adoption of new technologies and to innovation in heavily regulated domains. [20]
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Conclusion
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the beginning of this study, we highlighted the growing concern that Canada has failed to benefit from its strength in science and technology when it comes to \'adsuccessfully commercializing innovation. The last two decades have seen a proliferation of university-industry funding programs. Yet these have failed to produce the desired outcomes. Something different is needed. Taking the bull by the horns, so to speak, the government initiated the Innovation Superclusters Initiative to try to reverse the downward trajectory of innovation. Starting from the premise that united we stand, the program aims to build a critical mass of partnerships between research facilities and industry that will boost innovation, productivity and competitiveness. Encouraging a more coordinated approach to ensure that transformative technologies[21] reinvigorate industrial capabilities is a bold move that is being followed closely by other countries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Noting that the Canadian superclusters are in fact more akin to innovation ecosystems than clusters, we briefly surveyed the pertinent literature on the building blocks of innovation ecosystems. These include industrial clusters, knowledge networks, collaboration and open innovation. As none of the lenses suffices to comprehend the dynamics of innovation ecosystems, we argued that a multidisciplinary framework needs to be developed to fully understand how the superclusters operate, to measure whether their goals are achieved, and to evaluate their performance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Furthermore, as they prepare for the adoption, diffusion and impact of discontinuous and potentially disruptive technologies such as AI and industry 4.0, Canadian firms are having to acquire a whole new set of skills that they may not have the capacity to absorb on their own. The speed at which new technologies are being developed forces all stakeholders to be involved from the beginning in well-coordinated collaborative entities, such as innovation ecosystems or superclusters. Accurately monitoring the success of innovation ecosystems and of the firms and organizations therein requires the development of new indicators. These indicators would complement the traditional key performance indicators that we automatically turn to because they are relatively easy to measure, master and understand. Herein lies the challenge. The extent of the coordination required to ensure the success of the superclusters, or to propose how to change tack in real time if need be, is unprecedented. So too is the task entailed in accurately measuring that success.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Developing, testing and providing new and more appropriate performance indicators for innovation ecosystems is the challenge our team took on in 2018. Such indicators will be invaluable. They will ensure that the cross-cutting impact and innovation potential of integrating knowledge and technology from multiple sectors and disciplines is taken into account. They will also help Canada develop effective and reinforcing innovation policies and regulatory frameworks adapted to innovation ecosystems. The results of our research will help Canadian innovation ecosystems, including the superclusters, evolve and have a long-lasting positive impact on our economy.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Whether President Trump is reelected or Vice President Biden wins, America is not likely to know the outcome of the contest for days, or even weeks. The reason is simple: the rush to mail-in balloting will overwhelm the local elections officials who do the job of counting the vote.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In-person votes cast either early or on Election Day are typically counted by machine, usually by computers. As such, in person voting\'97the only sure way to know your vote isn\'92t lost in the mail\'97is counted quickly on election night.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But in-person voting has been steadily dwindling as a share of the total vote as more and more citizens embrace voting by mail. There are a variety of reasons for this, ranging from convenience to aggressive ballot harvesting efforts, largely by progressives and organized labor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Our Constitution sets out a republican form of government. This means we don\'92t have a direct democracy, but rather a republic. This is why the Electoral College chooses the president and vice president. Each state gets as many votes as they have members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. senators (Washington, D.C. get three votes).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to the Real Clear Politics\'a02020 Electoral College Map, 187 out of 538 Electoral College votes are too close to call with 226 solid or leaning for Biden and 125 solid or leaning for Trump. Assuming all Electors are seated and vote, it takes 270 votes to win.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most media organizations have already calculated what it will take to \'93call\'94 a state for a specific candidate. A state is called when, based on history, polling, exit polling, and understanding of the composition of the counted vote\'97for instance, how much of the vote has come in from more liberal urban areas vs. more conservative suburban and rural areas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The challenge for 2020\'97it had to be 2020, of course\'97is that the flood of mail-in ballots is going to make calling certain states highly risky for the major media\'92s already battered reputation. The questions that affect the election night tally are: how much of the vote was by mail and is that known with certainty; when can local elections officials begin processing mail-in ballots to check for their validity (for instance, by matching signature); and, when can local officials begin counting the ballots?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2016, 57.2 million people\'a0voted early or by mail\'97about 42% of the vote and about double the share from 2004. Of those, 33.1 million sent their ballots in by mail\'97and these are the ballots that made it and were counted. According to the\'a0Washington Post, some 534,000 ballots were rejected during the 2020 primaries, either because they arrived late, the signature of the voter didn\'92t match what was on file, or other failures. In a separate analysis published in the\'a0Post\'a0that drew on his\'a0article\'a0in the\'a0Harvard 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Review, Charles Stewart III estimated that as many as 4.9% of mail-in ballots fail to result in a counted vote\'97that\'92s 1 in 20.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So, of the mail-in ballots that are validated and counted in the swing states, how soon after the polls close will they be counted? \'a0Real Clear Politics lists 11 states as too close to call. Of these,\'a0elections officials can process the mail-in ballots\'97meaning verifying that they are valid\'97prior to Election Day. Those state are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas. Unfortunately, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin don\'92t allow processing of mail-in ballots until Election Day. This is especially going to be a problem in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Michigan, elections officials mailed\'a07.7 million registered voters mail-in ballot applications. As of Oct. 5,\'a0more than 2.7 million Michigan voters requested mail-in ballots, a 145% increase from the 2016 presidential race with 380,000 mail-in ballots already received.\'a0Per a judge\'92s ruling in September, Michigan clerks must accept ballots arriving after Election Day so long as they are postmarked no later than Nov. 2 and received before the deadline for certifying election results, or 14 days after the election. The U.S. Postal Service frequently does not postmark envelopes containing ballots, leaving the ruling open to further litigation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Pennsylvania\'92s mail-in ballot challenge is even greater than Michigan\'92s. Officials expect 10 times the number of mail-in ballots in 2020 compared to 2016\'973 million. These ballots have until the Friday after Election Day to make it to elections officials by mail. Expecting\'97and in many cases, encouraging\'97this avalanche of mail, some elections officials asked the legislature to change the law and allow them to verify the ballots before Election Day. So far, the request has not resulted in a change to the law. As a result, there will be tremendous pressure to process mailed ballots to decide the election and this may result in a rushed verification effort, allowing a larger number of invalid or fraudulent ballots to be counted.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Once mail-in ballots are processed, they must be counted. Again,\'a0states have different rules governing the counting of mail-in ballots. Seven of the swing states allow the counting of mail-in ballots no earlier than Election Day\'97Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas (in the smaller counties\'97counties of more than 100,000 can start the count no earlier than the Friday before Election Day at 7 P.M.) and Wisconsin. Given that populous Texas counties can start counting days before Election Day, the status of Texas should be known sometime on Election Night. The same cannot be reasonably said for the other six states.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The upshot of these varying rules over the processing and counting of mail-in ballots\'97during a year when, because of concern over COVID-19, a far larger number of mail-in ballots are expected to be used\'97means that the final results from six states totaling 74 Electoral College votes isn\'92t likely to be known for days.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the case of Michigan and Pennsylvania, with ballots accepted two weeks and three days after Election Day, respectively, people\'97or fraudsters\'97might still be casting ballots after the election. This raises the specter of a Texas-like\'a0Box 13 scandal.\'a0Box 13\'a0was a ballot box that was \'93found\'94 six days after Election Day in the 1948 contest that elevated Lyndon Johnson to the U.S. Senate. It contained 202 votes\'97just enough to boost Johnson to victory\'97with the signature tally sheets for those 202 voters arranged in uniform handwriting with the names perfectly alphabetized.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The rush to accommodate millions of additional mail-in ballots for the 2020 General Election means that, unless the election is a landslide, we may not know the winner for weeks\'97and that\'92s the least bad outcome. At the other extreme, allowing millions of ballots to arrive and be counted days and weeks after the election invites fraud on a massive scale if not carefully monitored by representatives of both major campaigns.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Roy Cooper and Mandy Cohen claim to be following the \'93science and data,\'94 while ignoring the data about the negative consequences of their shutdown orders
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The negative consequences have been devastating, and include death, mental health issues, financial struggles and growing racial inequality
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mounting evidence tells us the shutdown may do more harm than good
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As North Carolina remains confined to Gov. Roy Cooper\'92s lockdown \'91Phase 2.5,\'92 many questions remain unanswered. Cooper and DHHS Secretary Mandy Cohen have been criticized for their lack of transparency, and their staged, friendly press conferences.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Both claim to be following the \'93science and data,\'94 but neither is equipped to answer the pressing question: is the lockdown doing more harm than good?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Secure in the knowledge that the media will not ask them about the negative consequences of the prolonged lockdown, Cooper and Cohen can focus exclusively on tracking cases, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid while ignoring the devastating tradeoffs suffered by North Carolinians from their efforts to \'93contain\'94 the virus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Cooper, an attorney and long-time politician, and Cohen, educated in internal medicine and public health, both lack training that would empower them to perceptively consider and weigh opportunity costs and trade-offs involved with their policies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Make no mistake, there is growing evidence that the prolonged shutdown is causing more harm to North Carolinians than good.

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Deaths of Despair
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Cooper\'92s and Cohen\'92s efforts to protect the public\'92s health from Covid-19 come with significant negative health consequences of their own.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Researchers have predicted as many as\'a075,000 deaths of despair\'a0nationally (i.e. suicide, substance abuse) resulting from the lockdowns. This May study released by WellBeing Trust and the Robert Graham Center projected nearly 2,500 additional deaths of despair in North Carolina due to the lockdown.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lockdowns are especially cruel on our young people. Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield said in a July\'a0Buck Institute webinar\'a0that suicides are claiming more lives of high schoolers than Covid itself.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93But there has been another cost that we\'92ve seen, particularly in high schools,\'94 Redfield said. \'93We\'92re seeing, sadly, far greater suicides now than we are deaths from COVID.\'94 Redfield also noted the spike in drug overdoses, \'93We\'92re seeing far greater deaths from drug overdose that are above excess that we had as background than we are seeing the deaths from COVID.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to the\'a0American Medical Association, \'93More than 35 states have reported increases in opioid-related mortality as well as ongoing concerns for those with a mental illness or substance use disorder in counties and other areas within the state.\'94 Sadly, North Carolina is among them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Statewide data for North Carolina is not readily available, but this August 7 article in RockinghamNow reports \'93Drug overdose calls more than doubled during the pandemic, compared to the same time frame last year, according to statistics kept by the Rockingham County Sheriff\'92s Office.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This August North Carolina Health News article reported that \'93The state has seen a 15 percent spike in\'a0opioid overdoses\'a0since the pandemic began.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And according to this recent Asheville Citizen Times article, \'93Statewide data shows symptoms of depression and anxiety have tripled amid the pandemic, according to\'a0Victor Armstrong, executive director of\'a0the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A disturbing 25 percent of young adults nationally age 18-24 have considered suicide in the past 30 days, as reported by Politico recently, a rate significantly higher than past surveys.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The government shutdowns have unleashed devastating mental health and substance abuse problems, many of which are turning deadly. Lives lost and shattered, especially among our youth who face little risk of infection and minute risk of significant symptoms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When will Cooper and Cohen acknowledge and reckon with these heartbreaking consequences of their actions?

\f1\b\fs20 \'93Disease surge\'94 from lockdowns
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Because of the hospitals shuttering non-COVID treatment and screenings, and people\'92s irrational fear of going to the doctor or hospital, doctors have warned of a \'93disease surge\'94 causing additional deaths that could \'93end up rivaling or exceeding deaths due to Covid-19.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 According to\'a0CancerHealth.com, \'93screenings for\'a0breast,\'a0cervix\'a0and\'a0colon\'a0cancer are down between 86% and 94%\'94 as of May. Also, a\'a0report by Human 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone \'a0estimated \'93More than 80,000 diagnoses of five common cancers may be missed or delayed by early June because of disruptions to health care\'94 due to COVID lockdowns and restrictions. Of course, early diagnoses of cancer can lead to earlier treatment and a higher survival rate. Delayed screenings can translate into more deaths.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The longer the lockdown, the more these types of deaths are likely to mount. How many of our loved ones will suffer? Will Cooper and Cohen ever be asked about this?

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Heavy job losses
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mental health and substance abuse problems are associated with unemployment. Forcing the closure of thousands of businesses across the state for months no doubt has contributed to such problems noted above.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics reported by the NC Commerce Department, the number of seasonally-adjusted employed North Carolinians fell from a pre-Covid 4.93 million in February to a low of 4.08 million in April. The number of unemployed more than tripled from 182,606 to 615,512 in May. The more than tripling of the number of unemployed drove up \'a0the state\'92s unemployment rate from 3.6 percent in April to 12.8 percent in May.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Slow and gradual re-openings of businesses have dropped the unemployment rate to 8.5 percent for July, and increased the total number employed to 4.5 million.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The stress and anxiety caused by losing one\'92s job combined with the uncertainty of Cooper\'92s haphazard and unpredictable phase plan has contributed to the rising public health crises like substance abuse and rising suicide rates.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Are Cooper and Cohen intentionally ignoring these effects, or just ignorant of them? Neither answer speaks well of their leadership.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Growing Inequality
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For a group that constantly claims to champion \'93equality,\'94 Cooper\'92s and Cohen\'92s shutdown has significantly exacerbated racial inequality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The shutdown has resulted in a significant number of business closures, disproportionately harming black-owned small businesses.\'a0A June report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the number of African-American business owners nationally dropped from 1.1 million in February 2020 to 640,000 in April.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The roughly 42% drop in black-owned businesses due to the lockdown dwarfs the 17% decline\'a0 experienced by white-owned businesses. Immigrant businesses saw a decline of 36%. There\'92s little reason to believe that North Carolina\'92s experience differs from these trends.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Furthermore, job losses from the lockdown struck the black community much more severely.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Naturally, the economic devastation will increase poverty. This July article by the far-left NC Policy Watch quotes Lisa Gennetian, an associate professor of early learning policy studies in Duke\'92s Sanford School of Public Policy, as saying that \'93some estimates suggest that child poverty could grow by 5 million children\'94 nationally, with Gennetian adding \'93Children of color will be particularly hit hard.\'94 How many of those children thrust into poverty in North Carolina due to Cooper\'92s shutdown will never climb back out?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In short, the Cooper shutdown has exacerbated racial wealth inequality in North Carolina, a blow that may take a generation to recover from.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And the negative educational consequences of Cooper\'92s and Cohen\'92s muddled plans for school re-opening \'97 which to a large degree left most school districts with no realistic option other than to start schools completely online \'97 potentially ensures racial wealth inequality is made\'a0 worse for the next generation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As reported by Policy Watch in late June, students could lose as much as 30 percent of reading gains and 50 percent of math gains from the previous year, due to the \'93Covid slide.\'94 More specifically, the educational achievement gap for Black and Hispanic students could increase by another 15 \'96 20 percent. Will anyone ask Cooper and Cohen when they think this gap will be made up?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Policy Watch also reported an expected spike in high school dropouts as a result of extended disruptions to learning, with Black and Hispanic students dropping out at disproportionate rates.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Imagine the future for Black and Hispanic students who fall further behind and drop out of school in larger numbers. What will their life look like in 10, 20 or 30 years? What kind of neighborhood will they be able to live in? What sort of future will they be able to provide for their children?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Cooper\'92s and Cohen\'92s shutdown may be temporary, but the negative consequences can become generational. Have they taken any of this into consideration?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Conclusion
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Neither Cooper nor Cohen has any training equipping them to sensibly evaluate trade-offs from their lockdowns. Their singular focus on trying to reduce new Covid cases has blinded them to the horrific negative consequences of their actions \'96 consequences which may outweigh any benefit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Adding insult to injury is this recent analysis of CDC data by the data-aggregation website Rational Ground. The analysis found that not only were stay-at-home orders ineffective, but states with more stringent lockdown orders were associated with higher rates of infection per 100k population.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Moreover, as this Sept. 9 article in the Financial Review reported, \'93Lockdowns beyond two months impose massive economic costs without any real health benefits because they only delay an inevitable second wave of the virus, according to a new international COVID-19 study by former Reserve Bank of Australia economist Greg Kaplan.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Specifically, Kaplan noted, \'93In the US, we found that around two months was the inflection point where the economic costs start to get very steep and all you\'92re doing is really killing the economy with little additional impact on deaths.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So not only did the shutdown destroy countless lives, it\'92s entirely possible that it provided no benefit.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A new economic impact report from Yelp shows that a majority of businesses on the platform that closed during the COVID-19 pandemic will not be reopening.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Data show a total of 163,735 businesses on Yelp closed between March 1 and August 31, when state-enforced lockdowns across the US began forcing businesses to close their doors. According to Yelp\'92s figures, 97,966 of those businesses (60 percent) will not be reopening.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Overall, Yelp\'92s data shows that business closures have continued to rise with a 34% increase in permanent closures since our last report in mid-July,\'94 Justin Norman, vice president of 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Yelp, told CNBC.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The closures have not impacted all sectors of the economy equally, however. Yelp\'92s report shows that some professions\'97lawyers, architects, accountants, physicians, and real estate agents\'97have been able to weather the pandemic storm more effectively, representing just two to three businesses closed per thousand.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A new Yelp report says that 60% of 163,735 businesses closed on its platform will never open again.

\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Demand for some local services has also remained high. Auto service providers, plumbers, and independent contractors have closed at higher rates than doctors and lawyers\'97representing six to seven business closures out of every thousand\'97but far lower than the five business sectors hit hardest: restaurants, bars, retail, fitness, and the beauty industry.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Here are highlights from the report:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Restaurants
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Restaurants\'97particularly Mexican restaurants, breakfast and brunch joints, burger and sandwich shops, and dessert places\'97continue to get pounded by lockdowns. A total of 32,109 restaurants on Yelp had closed as of the end of August, 19,590 of which were permanent (61 percent).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Places that offer foods conducive for delivery have fared a little better, including coffee shops and bakeries, delis, food trucks, and pizza joints.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bars
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bars and nightlife, an industry six times smaller than restaurants, have suffered an especially high closure rate. As of August 31, there were 6,451 business closures on Yelp, 3,499 of which were permanent (54 percent).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The share of permanent closures within bars and nightlife have increased by 10% since our Economic Average Report in July,\'94 the report said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Retail
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Shopping and retail businesses followed close behind restaurants in total closures, with 30,374, 58 percent of which are permanent (17,503).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Both men and women\'92s clothing, as well as home decor, have the highest rate of business closures,\'94 the report found.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Beauty and Fitness Industries
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A total of 16,585 beauty businesses on Yelp have closed, 7,002 of which won\'92t reopen (42 percent). The fitness industry, meanwhile, has suffered a 23 percent increase in closures since July, and a total of 6,024 closures, 2,616 of which are permanent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lockdowns Exacerbated Inequality
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Small businesses, which comprise the bulk of Yelp\'92s business revenue, have suffered tremendously under the lockdowns. Meanwhile, big businesses not typically found on Yelp have fared much better. Indeed, many have benefited from the response to the pandemic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While we\'92ve heard phrases like \'93in this together\'94 and \'93we\'92re all in the same boat\'94 throughout the pandemic, the reality is Americans didn\'92t suffer through lockdowns equally. Some have been destroyed by forced closures while others have benefited from them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Stock guru and TV personality Jim Cramer wasn\'92t wrong when he observed this summer that the pandemic resulted in \'93one of the greatest wealth transfers in history.\'94 Cramer noticed that while small businesses were \'93dropping like flies,\'94 corporations were growing stronger and their stock prices were swelling.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Data bear out these claims.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Greg Buzek, the founder and President of IHL Group, wrote that smaller retailers saw about a quarter of a trillion dollars shift to large retailers during the first three months of the pandemic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93IHL estimates that over $250 billion alone shifted from smaller retailers (with 50 or fewer locations) to larger retailers due to lockdowns in North America alone, forcing over 285,000 small businesses out of business,\'94 Buzek wrote.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This confirms what Dan Sanchez and I wrote in June: America\'92s small businesses have been horribly abused throughout this pandemic. Through no fault of their own, many small business owners saw their dreams go up in smoke as bigger retailers and online stores thrived. What\'92s perhaps worse is that for months they were told to be quiet while their basic freedom\'97the ability to earn a living\'97was violated.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Meanwhile corporate America grew fat. Companies like Target set new sales records as their market share swelled from the sidelined competition, and a flood of capital flowed to the largest corporations, which appeared to be the safest havens for investors\'92 cash. As Peter R. Orszag of Bloomberg News observed, it was the corporate version of the Matthew effect: The strong got stronger.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Meanwhile, as they were benefiting from the pandemic, corporate America inundated us with a steady stream of pro-lockdown mass messaging, played to (obligatory) somber piano and containing predictable phrases\'97\'93rise above,\'94 \'93stay apart,\'94 \'93we\'92re in this together.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Catchphrases cannot mask the reality that economic lockdowns made inequality in America much worse. Tens of millions of Americans lost jobs and millions of businesses were closed or forced to the brink of closure.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The solution to the problem, we were told, was Washington, DC. Trillions of dollars were pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve to finance bailouts and send checks to Americans. The bailouts were a huge success\'97for the rich. Six months into the pandemic, Wall Street keeps setting new records.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It turns out lockdowns were not just inhumane; they were deeply unjust.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Lingering Effects of Lockdowns
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It would be easy to look at the stock market and think America has weathered the pandemic fine. This would be a mistake.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is a concept in economics known as regime uncertainty. Coined by Robert Higgs, the term describes \'93a pervasive lack of confidence among investors in their ability to foresee the extent to which future government actions will alter their private-property rights.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Capital investment\'97whether by an entrepreneur starting a hardware store or a venture capital group investing a sum in a business\'97is the source of wealth creation. But people are less likely to invest their capital in places their property rights are insecure.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Higgs argues that one of the reasons the Great Depression lasted so long was regime uncertainty. Depression-era Americans did not have much faith that Franklin Roosevelt would secure their rights of property. FDR, after all, tried to pass a 100 percent tax rate via executive order. That lends itself to a high degree of uncertainty.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Uncertainty can range from erratic tax rates to regulatory barriers to outright property confiscation. While some uncertainties are more harmful than others, few would argue that unilateral state-enforced lockdowns inject a high degree of uncertainty into the American economy. It\'92s not just the fact that businesses were shut down, it was also in the nature of the shutdowns, which were often arbitrary, unfairly applied, and quickly became indefinite in nature. \'93Fifteen days to slow the spread\'94 quickly changed to \'93We\'92ll let you know when it\'92s safe to open.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fortunately, the checks and balances embedded in the American system may help return a degree of economic certainty that has been lost in 2020.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A federal court recently ruled that Pennsylvania's economic lockdown was unconstitutional, noting that an economy is not \'93a machine that can be shut down and restarted at will by government. It is an organic system made up of free people each pursuing their dreams.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered. The liberties protected by the Constitution are not fair-weather freedoms \'97 in place when times are good but able to be cast aside in times of trouble. There is no question that this country has faced, and will face, emergencies of every sort. But the solution to a national crisis can never be permitted to supersede the commitment to individual liberty that stands as the foundation of the American experiment. The Constitution cannot accept the concept of a \'91new normal\'92 where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The court\'92s ruling comes too late to save the 97,966 businesses on Yelp that will never open again after closing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But it could offer protection to the businesses of tomorrow\'97and return a degree of certainty to an economy that needs it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Aug 27, 2020 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) - Pomar Lane, a data analytics firm specializing in real estate modeling, today completed a demonstration project that estimated condition scores for over 90 thousand homes. Home condition is represented by the Pomar Condition Score, the first measure of home condition based on advanced analytics rather than expensive inspections or appraisals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "Online real estate sites commonly present home prices, but have a tremendous blind spot when it comes to home condition. This changes with the availability of the Pomar Condition Scoring System. Our intent is to provide the home buyer with individual home condition scores and renewal costs for all major U.S. residential markets," said company CEO Peter Lufkin. "And the need for condition data extends beyond online search."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He adds, "We foresee a time when any transaction depending on the value of your house will require a condition rating. Apply for a mortgage, purchase homeowner insurance, or market a short-term rental-these all can depend on the Pomar Score as an objective and inexpensive measure of home condition."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Pomar Score is based on the structural value of the home. Scaled from 1 to 100, a low value indicates little investment in maintenance and repair, while a high value indicates the homeowner is keeping up with wear and tear as the home ages. The predicted score comes from a unique learning model that incorporates changing home characteristics, neighborhood features and local economic data.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Developed over the last three years, the proprietary algorithm delivers for each home:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 * a condition score that measures the remaining value of the home structure
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 * an average condition score for the vicinity
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 * a range of estimated renewal costs depending on maintenance style
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The estimated scores are highly correlated with actual appraisal results, yet can be generated for a small fraction of appraisal costs. As a service, Pomar Lane will provide regular condition updates for homes in key U.S. markets.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 About Pomar Lane
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Pomar Lane LLC is developing a nationwide database of home condition scores and renewal costs. We use 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  instead of costly inspections to score property condition. Pomar models can inform the choices of individual home buyers. Our tools can help reduce insurance claims, improve investor decisions, and make valuation models more accurate.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A reforma do Estado brasileiro torna-se o \'fanico meio vi\'e1vel para a otimiza\'e7\'e3o de recursos p\'fablicos, que atenda a atual demanda social, antes de o pa\'eds voltar a crescer. Isso porque o aumento da despesa p\'fablica, decorrente do necess\'e1rio apoio financeiro aos trabalhadores informais e desempregados, acontece no mesmo instante em que h\'e1 queda da atividade econ\'f4mica, respons\'e1vel por derrubar as receitas governamentais, e sem o menor espa\'e7o para aumento de tributos.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 O gasto com pessoal j\'e1 \'e9 uma das tr\'eas maiores despesas do Estado brasileiro: s\'e3o R$ 928 bilh\'f5es por ano, o que representa 13,7% do PIB. \'c9 um desafio para todos os entes federativos, j\'e1 que, por mais que o custo da folha em \'e2mbitos federal e estadual seja alto, h\'e1 um poss\'edvel incha\'e7o da m\'e1quina p\'fablica em \'e2mbito municipal, onde est\'e3o 57% dos 11,4 milh\'f5es de servidores.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Esses dados est\'e3o no estudo \'93Reforma administrativa: diagn\'f3sticos sobre a empregabilidade, o desempenho e a efici\'eancia do setor p\'fablico\'94, feito pelo Instituto Millenium em parceria com a consultoria de

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Millenium Explica: por que precisamos de uma reforma administrativa?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Destrava! Por uma Reforma Administrativa do bem
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Sal\'e1rio de servidor consome 3,5 vezes o gasto com sa\'fade
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Os dados sobre distribui\'e7\'e3o de recursos e pessoal indicam haver espa\'e7o para ganhos de efici\'eancia na m\'e1quina p\'fablica, como atrelar gratifica\'e7\'f5es a um adequado sistema de avalia\'e7\'f5es de desempenho, com maior chance de qualifica\'e7\'e3o, e uma evolu\'e7\'e3o funcional mais alinhada aos resultados; o que s\'f3 \'e9 poss\'edvel, tamb\'e9m, atrav\'e9s de metas fact\'edveis. Outra necessidade latente \'e9 o debate sobre as adequa\'e7\'f5es de contingente, mais alinhadas \'e0s demandas sociais, para evitar a falta de servidores em \'e1reas sens\'edveis, conforme v\'eam alertando os economistas Arminio Fraga e Ana Carla Abr\'e3o.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mais do que a import\'e2ncia fiscal, uma reforma administrativa tem potencial para causar um impacto social significativo \'97n\'e3o s\'f3 porque \'e1reas fundamentais como sa\'fade, seguran\'e7a, habita\'e7\'e3o e saneamento recebem cada vez menos aten\'e7\'e3o e financiamentos, j\'e1 que a despesa obrigat\'f3ria (em sua maior parte representada pelo gasto com pessoal) faz com que o gasto p\'fablico cres\'e7a de forma vegetativa\'97, mas tamb\'e9m porque uma m\'e1quina p\'fablica mais eficiente entrega mais servi\'e7os de qualidade a quem precisa.

\f2\fs20 O estudo aponta que, entre os anos de 2020 e 2034, 36,24% de todos os servidores do funcionalismo p\'fablico federal v\'e3o se aposentar. Ou seja, 219 mil servidores precisar\'e3o ser repostos atrav\'e9s de novos concursos, tratando-se, portanto, de uma grande oportunidade para implementar melhorias \'e0s regras de recursos humanos da gest\'e3o p\'fablica que fortale\'e7am, inclusive, a independ\'eancia t\'e9cnica dos servidores.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Outro ponto relevante \'e9 que parece haver disposi\'e7\'e3o e espa\'e7o pol\'edtico para o debate. Os senadores Antonio Anastasia (PSD-MG) e K\'e1tia Abreu (PP-TO), al\'e9m do deputado Tiago Mitraud (Novo-MG), presidente da Frente Parlamentar Mista da Reforma Administrativa, t\'eam dado declara\'e7\'f5es p\'fablicas favor\'e1veis \'e0 discuss\'e3o do tema neste momento. Ademais, o presidente da C\'e2mara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), tem enfatizado que a discuss\'e3o de uma reforma administrativa neste momento n\'e3o representaria desencontros em rela\'e7\'e3o \'e0 agenda de outras mat\'e9rias ou PECs em pauta nas duas Casas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Enfim, podemos afirmar que pol\'edticas p\'fablicas eficientes, eficazes e efetivas s\'e3o mais prov\'e1veis com a exist\'eancia de um arcabou\'e7o de incentivos \'e0 produtividade. E que tais incentivos podem contribuir significativamente para a promo\'e7\'e3o da igualdade de oportunidades e para a diminui\'e7\'e3o da pobreza, alicerces de fundamental import\'e2ncia para uma na\'e7\'e3o que deseja caminhar rumo ao desenvolvimento.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Como o gr\'e1fico abaixo mostra, Python \'e9 cada vez mais a principal linguagem usada no\'a0desenvolvimento de modelos de machine learning (ML). De fato ele est\'e1 se tornando a\'a0linguagem de programa\'e7\'e3o mais popular do mundo.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Isso n\'e3o acontece \'e0 toa: Python \'e9 uma linguagem relativamente simples, open-source (em particular, gratuita), muito flex\'edvel, e que hoje conta como uma comunidade vibrante de programadores que constantemente criam e atualizam pacotes de fun\'e7\'f5es voltados para diversas tarefas, ML entre elas.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Abaixo vai um poss\'edvel roteiro para se aprender e praticar Python online. N\'e3o \'e9 o \'fanico e nem necessariamente o melhor caminho, mas funciona muito bem se voc\'ea estiver disposto a dedicar energia e tempo a ele.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 1 - DataCamp (
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ) para aprender a sintaxe e ter uma no\'e7\'e3o geral da linguagem
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 2 - Nanodegrees do Udacity (      \'a0    
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://www.udacity.com/school-of-
\f4\b data-science
\f2\i0\b0 \cf0 \ulnone ) para aprender os aspectos "pr\'e1ticos" da linguagem. A did\'e1tica dos v\'eddeos e textos em geral \'e9 muito boa. A \'eanfase \'e9 muito mais pr\'e1tica do que te\'f3rica; o Udacity n\'e3o tem a pegada "acad\'eamica" do Coursera. H\'e1 grupos, tanto no site quanto no WhatsApp, para tirar d\'favidas e trocar ideias com os professores e colegas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 3 - Pratique Python no HackerRank (      \'a0    
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://www.hackerrank.com/
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ) para ganhar flu\'eancia. Os exerc\'edcios surgem em dificuldade crescente, e as p\'e1ginas de discuss\'e3o do site cont\'e9m dicas de como resolv\'ea-los de maneira eficiente e elegante.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 4 - Busque proativamente blogs e tutoriais voltados para programa\'e7\'e3o em Python aplicada a

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 5 - Uma vez que o feij\'e3o-com-arroz da linguagem estiver dominado, se dedique a um projeto "do mundo real", remunerado ou n\'e3o. O fundamental para manter a motiva\'e7\'e3o \'e9 encontrar um desafio que empolgue.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 6 - Use e abuse do Stack Overflow (      \'a0

\f2\fs20 Obs: O HackerRank e o Stack Overflow s\'e3o gratuitos, enquanto que a maioria dos cursos do DataCamp e do Udacity s\'e3o pagos. Com um pouco de pesquisa online \'e9 poss\'edvel encontrar alternativas gratuitas, ainda que provavelmente de menor qualidade.

Ao longo dos anos, o Estado brasileiro foi capturado por grupos de interesse que, hoje, recebem sal\'e1rios e benef\'edcios incompat\'edveis com a realidade. Para se ter uma ideia, dados da pesquisa mostram que, nas \'faltimas tr\'eas d\'e9cadas, o gasto com <strong>funcionalismo</strong>\'a0mais do que dobrou, e esse aumento n\'e3o est\'e1 atrelado a melhorias no servi\'e7o p\'fablico.

Al\'e9m disso, h\'e1 desigualdades no pr\'f3prio sistema, j\'e1 que faltam <strong>servidores</strong> na base e muitas carreiras ainda s\'e3o desvalorizadas, enquanto outras recebem supersal\'e1rios e benef\'edcios irreais. A pesquisa escancara outra situa\'e7\'e3o alarmante: o atual modelo estimula a concentra\'e7\'e3o de renda.

\f2\fs20 About the Niskanen Center
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Niskanen Center is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) think tank that works to promote an open society - a social order that is open to political, cultural, and social change - through active engagement in the war of ideas and direct engagement in the policymaking process. We develop policy proposals, mobilize other groups to support those proposals, promote those ideas to legislative and executive decision-makers, build short- and longer-term coalitions to facilitate joint action, initiate litigation to compel responses in defense of individual rights, and marshal the most convincing arguments and information in support of our agenda.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Our commitment to an open society extends to our own organization. The Niskanen Center does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. To ensure the integrity of this aspect of our application process, submissions are initially screened by directors in a way that is stripped of potentially identifying information.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We currently plan to accept applications for this job until filled. However, we hope to have this position filled by Jan. 1, 2018. Candidates in whom we are interested will be contacted for telephone interviews within two weeks of applying. In-person interviews will be held in our D.C. office. To apply, please send a resume (Microsoft Word or PDF) with a cover letter pasted into the body of the email to shammond [at] niskanencenter [dot] org. Completed applications should include a short writing sample (less than 800 words) and an illustration of proficiency in data analysis and visualization in a readily accessible format.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'a0</p><p>\'93A principal motiva\'e7\'e3o para uma <strong>reforma</strong> do Estado n\'e3o deve ser a quest\'e3o fiscal, que pode at\'e9 ter um impacto. Mas, muito mais relevante do que isso, \'e9 fazer o Estado funcionar melhor, entregando servi\'e7os de melhor qualidade para a popula\'e7\'e3o, que precisa disso para poder se desenvolver e, dessa forma, desenvolver o pa\'eds\'94, afirmou o economista, que realizou um estudo com uma minuta de projeto de lei, estabelecendo bases para uma poss\'edvel reforma administrativa.</p><p><strong>Leia mais<br /></strong>Millenium lan\'e7a campanha Destrava!<br />Aod Cunha. Solange Srour e Wagner Vargas debateram ao vivo necessidade de reforma administrativa</p><p>Arm\'ednio Fraga destacou que o conjunto de reformas estatais vai permitir o aperfei\'e7oamento das pol\'edticas p\'fablicas e da aloca\'e7\'e3o de recursos. \'93Tudo o que se faz no Estado deveria ser planejado, justificado e avaliado, para que ocorra progresso, para que se entenda o que est\'e1 dando resultado e o que n\'e3o est\'e1 dando certo. E isso n\'e3o pode acontecer se os pr\'f3prios servidores n\'e3o forem avaliados, incentivados e treinados para entregarem o que eles t\'eam de melhor. \'c9 uma composi\'e7\'e3o natural. Um Estado que \'e9 transparente, que se avalia, e corrige os seus rumos. As pessoas precisam trabalhar sob esse tipo de regime, que n\'e3o existe hoje no Brasil\'94, disse.</p><p><strong>Reduzir n\'famero de carreiras \'e9 ponto-chave </strong></p><p>Um dos pontos chaves da <strong>reforma administrativa</strong> defendida por Arm\'ednio Fraga \'e9 a redu\'e7\'e3o no n\'famero de carreiras, que hoje, est\'e3o \'e0s milhares. \'93H\'e1 uma confus\'e3o monumental. Essa \'e1rea merece uma grande revis\'e3o e simplifica\'e7\'e3o. \'c9 uma quest\'e3o de simplicidade, de ter m\'e9tricas de progress\'e3o com padr\'f5es de remunera\'e7\'e3o. Dessa forma, as diversas carreiras podem se encaixar no que deveria ser uma regra maior, e haveria tamb\'e9m maior clareza\'94, disse.</p><p>Outra quest\'e3o fundamental \'e9 a avalia\'e7\'e3o por desempenho, desde que feita por crit\'e9rios t\'e9cnicos, sem levar-se em conta quest\'f5es pol\'edticas e/ou ideol\'f3gicas. O ex-presidente do Banco Central destacou que v\'e1rios pa\'edses adotam tais regras, e que isso poderia ser trazido para o Brasil. Fraga, no entanto, alerta que n\'e3o se trata de aplicar no setor p\'fablico o modelo das empresas privadas, uma vez que h\'e1 peculiaridades que distinguem as duas atividades. \'93Mas \'e9 preciso que haja consequ\'eancias e que as pessoas sejam promovidas por m\'e9rito, esfor\'e7o e personalidade, e n\'e3o por antiguidades ou favoritismos\'94, disse.</p><p>Mas qual seria a modelagem ideal? De acordo com o economista, isso geralmente \'e9 feito em sistemas com grupos ou comit\'eas, tornando essa avalia\'e7\'e3o impessoal. Funciona da seguinte forma: uma \'e1rea de Recursos Humanos \'e9 criada, onde as carreiras dos profissionais s\'e3o acompanhadas, permitindo que as pessoas sejam ajudadas quando precisam e tamb\'e9m que se apontem pontos cr\'edticos ao desempenho de cada um, gerando a corre\'e7\'e3o e a avalia\'e7\'e3o.</p><p><strong>Destrava! </strong></p><p>A pandemia do novo Coronav\'edrus impulsionou o agravamento nas contas p\'fablicas. Tal cen\'e1rio coloca o Brasil em um momento crucial para tomar decis\'f5es com consequ\'eancias claras para o seu futuro. No cerne desta quest\'e3o, encontra-se a urgente <strong>reforma administrativa</strong>. Por isso, o Instituto Millenium lan\'e7ou a campanha<strong> Destrava! Por uma reforma administrativa do bem</strong>. A mobiliza\'e7\'e3o nacional conta com o apoio de grandes especialistas brasileiros e busca estimular a discuss\'e3o em torno de um modelo com mais igualdade, inova\'e7\'e3o e transpar\'eancia, al\'e9m de um ambiente melhor para todos os servidores.</p><p>A campanha, que pretende conscientizar sobre a import\'e2ncia da pauta retornar \'e0 agenda do Congresso, traz a p\'fablico o estudo in\'e9dito \'93Reforma Administrativa: diagn\'f3sticos sobre a empregabilidade, o desempenho e a efici\'eancia do Setor P\'fablico\'94, desenvolvido em parceria entre o Instituto Millenium e a consultoria de

Enquanto os gastos com sa\'fade somaram 3,9% do PIB, a educa\'e7\'e3o recebeu 6% do PIB, de acordo com os c\'e1lculos do instituto.</p><p><strong>Raio-x dos servidores</strong> <strong>p\'fablicos</strong><br />Estudo faz radiografia in\'e9dita do funcionalismo no Brasil</p><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186051 size-full" src="

\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ODX.

\f2\fs20 O estudo, ao qual o Estad\'e3o teve acesso, foi feito com uso de tecnologias de intelig\'eancia artificial e t\'e9cnicas de an\'e1lise de big data (capacidade de retirar valor de uma grande quantidade de dados em velocidade r\'e1pida). O Millenium analisa os encargos da m\'e1quina p\'fablica com pessoal nos \'faltimos 30 anos, al\'e9m dos impactos do engessamento or\'e7ament\'e1rio com pessoal e o grau de urg\'eancia da reforma administrativa.</p><p>Depois do envio da primeira parte da reforma tribut\'e1ria pelo governo, a press\'e3o pela aprova\'e7\'e3o da reforma administrativa se intensificou junto com a press\'e3o por aumento de gastos, queda dos investimentos, crescimento da d\'edvida p\'fablica e risco de flexibiliza\'e7\'e3o do teto de gastos \'96 a regra que trava o crescimento das despesas \'e0 varia\'e7\'e3o da infla\'e7\'e3o.</p><p>A apresenta\'e7\'e3o da proposta de reforma administrativa \'e9 considerada uma prerrogativa exclusiva do Executivo. Ao Estad\'e3o, o presidente da C\'e2mara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), cobrou do governo a proposta para que a Casa possa come\'e7ar a discutir o texto para se evitar uma \'93gambiarra fiscal\'94 nesse momento de crise.</p><p>\'93O gasto com pessoal drena recursos que iriam para os investimentos e pressiona a d\'edvida p\'fablica, que permanece com vi\'e9s de alta, mesmo com a infla\'e7\'e3o e a taxa b\'e1sica de juros controladas\'94, diz Priscila Pereira Pinto, CEO do Instituto Millenium.</p><p>Segundo Priscila, o instituto decidiu encabe\'e7ar a campanha porque, com a crise econ\'f4mica provocada pela covid-19, o Estado brasileiro \'93est\'e1 quebrando\'94 e recolhendo cada vez menos impostos. Na sua avalia\'e7\'e3o, n\'e3o adianta pensar somente em reforma tribut\'e1ria e privatiza\'e7\'f5es.</p><p><strong>Leia tamb\'e9m<br /></strong>A agenda liberal precisa continuar!<br />Reforma administrativa em pauta</p><p>\'93O Millenium acha importante voltarmos a pressionar o governo \'96 tanto o Executivo como o Legislativo \'96 para retomar a conversa da reforma administrativa\'94, diz. Ela alerta que o gasto com o funcionalismo vem aumentando e n\'e3o houve corte no meio da pandemia, enquanto os trabalhadores do setor privado sofreram muito. Segundo dados oficiais do governo, 9,5 milh\'f5es de trabalhadores tiveram o contrato suspenso ou o sal\'e1rio reduzido por causa dos efeitos da covid-19 na economia. A taxa oficial de desemprego no Pa\'eds subiu para 13,3% no trimestre encerrado em junho, atingindo 12,8 milh\'f5es de pessoas, com um fechamento de 8,9 milh\'f5es de postos de trabalho em apenas tr\'eas meses em meio aos impactos da pandemia.</p><p>Pelo diagn\'f3stico do instituto, dos 63,7 milh\'f5es de brasileiros que comp\'f5em a popula\'e7\'e3o ocupada, estima-se que 11,4 milh\'f5es tenham algum tipo de v\'ednculo empregat\'edcio direto com o setor p\'fablico (entre os celetistas mais estatut\'e1rios). Hoje, os servidores p\'fablicos estatut\'e1rios t\'eam direito \'e0 estabilidade ap\'f3s tr\'eas anos de efetivo exerc\'edcio, desde que aprovados em avalia\'e7\'e3o de desempenho. Quem faz concurso para empresas e sociedades de economia mista \'e9 chamado de empregado p\'fablico e est\'e1 submetido ao regime jur\'eddico estabelecido pela Consolida\'e7\'e3o das Leis do Trabalho (CLT).</p><p>O funcionalismo p\'fablico \'e9 composto 9,77 milh\'f5es de funcion\'e1rios, o que representa 21% dos 46 milh\'f5es de postos formais existentes atualmente no Brasil.</p><p><strong>Desigualdades</strong></p><p>O levantamento mostra que o patamar m\'e9dio de sal\'e1rios do funcionalismo p\'fablico federal coloca seus servidores no grupo dos 6% mais ricos, portanto, menos expostos \'e0 chamada regressividade do sistema tribut\'e1rio brasileiro (quadro que evidencia que quem ganha mais paga proporcionalmente menos impostos). A cr\'edtica \'e9 que essa situa\'e7\'e3o faz com que as atuais regras do servi\'e7o p\'fablico atuem como um distribuidor de renda \'e0s avessas, ou seja, um formato que acentua desigualdades sociais.</p><p>S\'f3 em 2019, os mais de 605 mil funcion\'e1rios federais civis, por exemplo, custaram R$ 319 bilh\'f5es de reais, 21 vezes mais do que os recursos investidos em saneamento (abastecimento de \'e1gua, coleta e tratamento de esgoto).</p><p>O estudo tamb\'e9m escancara a disparidade em rela\'e7\'e3o \'e0 iniciativa privada. Se as 30 ocupa\'e7\'f5es estatut\'e1rias mais numerosas do servi\'e7o p\'fablico recebessem a remunera\'e7\'e3o do seu equivalente no setor privado, haveria uma economia de aproximadamente R$ 15 bilh\'f5es por m\'eas aos cofres p\'fablicos, segundo os c\'e1lculos do estudo.</p><p>Para Priscila, fica claro tamb\'e9m a inefici\'eancia do sistema de avalia\'e7\'e3o: 95% dos funcion\'e1rios recebem bonifica\'e7\'e3o m\'e1xima por seu desempenho. Das 440 rubricas salariais, 369 n\'e3o t\'eam equival\'eancia no setor privado.</p><p><strong>Aposentadorias podem ser a janela para a reforma</strong></p><p>O levantamento do Instituto Millenium aponta que um ter\'e7o dos funcion\'e1rios efetivos do setor p\'fablico federal deve se aposentar at\'e9 2034. O diagn\'f3stico \'e9 que esse cen\'e1rio abre uma janela de oportunidade para implementar as mudan\'e7as da reforma administrativa j\'e1 que os novos servidores que ingressaram poder\'e3o seguir regras distintas. O grupo prestes a se aposentar, 219 mil pessoas acima de 51 anos, representa 36% dos funcion\'e1rios que est\'e3o atualmente na ativa.</p><p>O ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, e o secret\'e1rio especial de Desburocratiza\'e7\'e3o e Gest\'e3o do Minist\'e9rio da Economia, Paulo Uebel, respons\'e1vel pela coordena\'e7\'e3o da elabora\'e7\'e3o da proposta de reforma administrativa, s\'e3o ex-membros do instituto.</p><p>\'93H\'e1 uma urg\'eancia m\'e1xima em fazer uma reforma administrativa para que os novos servidores estejam em um ambiente com maiores incentivos \'e0 produtividade\'94, diz Wagner Vargas, s\'f3cio da consultoria ODX de intelig\'eancia de neg\'f3cios, que participou do estudo.</p><p>Segundo Vargas, dos 219 mil servidores que v\'e3o se aposentar na pr\'f3xima uma d\'e9cada e meia, 95% s\'e3o funcion\'e1rios estatut\'e1rios, com maior estabilidade no emprego. Isso significa que o governo vai precisar abrir novos concursos para repor esses cargos.</p><p>Para ele, a crise fiscal agravada pelo cen\'e1rio do coronav\'edrus aumenta essa urg\'eancia, pois o setor p\'fablico teve de aumentar seus gastos no mesmo instante em que o atual desaquecimento da atividade econ\'f4mica deve fazer a receita apresentar uma queda significativa. Como o gasto com pessoal \'e9 uma despesa obrigat\'f3ria, ele ocupa um espa\'e7o consider\'e1vel do or\'e7amento (93% das receitas s\'e3o obrigat\'f3rias) e reduz a quase a zero o espa\'e7o para investimentos, por exemplo.</p><p>O uso da ci\'eancia de dados para o estudo permitiu a implementa\'e7\'e3o de v\'e1rias t\'e9cnicas que envolvem automatiza\'e7\'e3o na coleta e trabalho de an\'e1lise dos dados. Foram utilizados algoritmos para fazer a coleta de dados em base oficiais e p\'fablicas.</p><p>O estudo chama aten\'e7\'e3o para o incha\'e7o de servidores na esfera municipal. Com uma m\'e9dia de 4,48% ao ano, o funcionalismo municipal foi o que mais cresceu; enquanto que os funcion\'e1rios p\'fablicos estaduais e federais apresentaram uma m\'e9dia anual de 1,4% ao ano. Os servidores municipais passaram de 1,7 milh\'e3o para 6,5 milh\'f5es entre 2002 e 2019.</p><p>Somados os tr\'eas Poderes das 5.570 cidades, o funcionalismo p\'fablico municipal tem um custo de 4,2 % do PIB (R$ 292 bilh\'f5es ao ano), o que \'e9 semelhante ao do federal. Mas os servidores federais, que representam 11% do funcionalismo, \'e9 que, proporcionalmente, t\'eam maior impacto fiscal. O custo m\'e9dio de um funcion\'e1rio federal \'e9 de R$ 242,4 mil ao ano, 5,7 vezes mais do que o custo m\'e9dio do servidor municipal e 2,7 vezes mais do que servidor vinculado ao funcionalismo estadual.</p><p>Fonte: \'93O Estado de S\'e3o Paulo\'94, 9/8/2020 (clique aqui e leia a mat\'e9ria completa)</p><p>O post Sal\'e1rio de servidor consome 3,5 vezes o gasto com sa\'fade apareceu primeiro em Instituto Millenium.</p>

A working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that PPP loans led to a 14 to 30 percentage point increase in a business\'92s expected survival rate and a positive, imprecise effect on employment.</p><p>The Small Business Association (SBA) will forgive loans for employee expenses if those employees are kept on the payroll during the pandemic. Employers can also keep the money if it is used for normal business expenses. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Those eligible to apply for assistance are businesses under 500 employees in size, sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals. Approximately $521 billion has been sent to 4.9 million businesses, including more than 600,000 businesses that received $150,000 loans or more each. The SBA has stated that small businesses generate 44 percent of U.S economic activity.</p><p>While the program temporarily put employees back on payroll, a tidal wave of bankruptcies is coming. Of the 5.1 million active businesses listed on Yelp, 132,580 are still closed because of the pandemic restrictions. Among business closures, 72,842, or 55 percent, have closed permanently. Justin Norman, Yelp\'92s Vice President of 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , said that the federal government should offer more help to small businesses to avoid the risk of additional small-business closures.</p><p>A July 7th survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Center (NFIB) found that \'93About 22% of PPP loan borrowers have or are anticipating having to lay off one or more employees after using their loan. This is up from 14% in mid-June. As business owners use the remainder of their loan balance, they are finding that economic conditions are unable to support current staffing levels which were previously supported by the PPP loan.\'94</p><p>Moreover, a Goldman Sachs survey found that 84 percent of small businesses that received PPP money would exhaust funding by the first week of August and only 16 percent are very confident that they can maintain payroll without further government relief. Just 37 percent of small businesses say they can survive another wave of shutdown restrictions and 63 percent are reporting revenues are only at 75 percent of their pre-COVID revenue levels.</p><p>Many businesses may not reach pre-COVID operation levels or support \'93re-payrolling\'94 due to a combination of state-ordered social distancing and a collapse in consumer demand. Initially, SBA stipulated that a PPP loan would only be forgiven if a majority of it were used to pay employee wages for eight weeks, which many companies opted to do. Washington state, despite the majority of other states choosing to cancel the requirement to replenish their own unemployment trust fund accounts, only waived the increased requirement if there was a COVID-19 infection at the business site.</p><p>The PPP program has gone through several notable changes since being initiated in April. The requirement that 75% of the money be used for payroll costs to qualify for forgiveness has been reduced to 60%. Furthermore, the time in which the money has to be spent was extended from eight to 24 weeks, helping ease some of the financial burdens on small businesses.</p><p>Aside from trying to maintain company payroll, small businesses are likely to use the PPP money to offset inflation from a weakened dollar for the next 24 months. Inflation is running higher than previously predicted and with an interest rate near zero, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates. $2 trillion in newly printed money has contributed to the worst one month drop in the dollar\'92s value in 10 years, as real 10-Year Treasury Yields have fallen to negative 0.97 percent.</p><p>Even for companies whose revenue has not changed in the last few months, the impact on revenues is likely in the long term. Many companies took the loan to \'93get over the hump,\'94 hoping that shutdown rules would ease by the fall. Some small businesses, especially restaurants, are staying open despite renewed restrictions. Facing the choice of being caught and fined by the state or go bankrupt, many are choosing to stay open.</p><p>The latest Washington Employment Report, reports the Washington unemployment level is 9.8 percent, 1.3 percent lower than the U.S average. At least 4,500 Seattle businesses have temporarily or permanently closed during the pandemic. For example, in La Conner, nine businesses have permanently closed or are closing. All but one has cited COVID-19 as the main reason for their closures. The Washington Department of Commerce gave grants to very small businesses through the Working Washington Small Business Grant Program. Over 1500 Washington businesses are expected to receive over $9.7 million in aid, saving 5,500 jobs, according to the government.</p><p>On July 28th, Governor Inslee announced he had stopped the relaxing of restrictions and allowing counties to move to the next phase of opening indefinitely. Effective July 30th, there are additional restrictions on restaurants, taverns, breweries, wineries, and distilleries, including ending alcohol service at 10:00 pm, reducing customer occupancy to 50 percent, reducing table size to five people, and prohibiting bar-area seating.</p><p>Indefinite shutdowns of thousands of Washington businesses are imposing real hardship on employers and working families. If shutdowns continue into the fall, expect to see another wave of bankruptcies and layoffs hit small businesses in Washington and around the country.</p>

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A new study by University of South Florida researchers aims to give medical professionals some early warning before COVID-19 patients take a turn for the worse.Study participants who have tested positive for the disease will wear a device to monitor their vital signs. The hope is that the resulting data will tell doctors what signals the body sends before a case of coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, becomes more serious."Coronavirus is kind of weird in that it seriously affects people differently," said researcher Andrew Bugajski, a faculty member in the College of Nursing.Business school professor Matt Mularkey, principal investigator on the study, said some otherwise healthy people who contract the virus end up with blood clots, fluid build-up in their lungs, neurological conditions or liver malfunctions among other possibilities."We all get it that, if you have any secondary conditions, this virus will take advantage of that," he said. "The vast majority would be otherwise healthy, but there's a small minority of otherwise healthy people that this virus seems to trigger and they rapidly go sideways. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In many ways, this is a 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  problem."With a large enough sample, Mularkey said, researchers will be able to track the physiological outcomes and monitor about 15 vital signs - from heart rate to skin temperature and oxygen saturation levels.The study will involve up to 150 consenting patients who will wear a noninvasive biometric tracking device for up to 21 days, providing real time feedback to the researchers. Patients will be monitored in groups of 10 at a time. The researchers have partnered with Shimmer, a company that manufactures the devices. The project is set to start in about two weeks."If the machines can learn the patterns, we may be able to identify early if something is going wrong," Mularkey said. "We could possibly give someone a two to four-day warning to go check with their doctor."Shimmer president Geoffrey Gill said in a statement that the devices can offer information that intermittent monitoring wouldn't allow for."The pandemic has put the world in a very unfortunate position, but we're proud that our wearable products may help clinicians slow or halt the progression of this terrible virus," he said.Mularkey said he believes the coronavirus may be around a while longer and thinks the study could be useful in any future viral outbreak where little existing research is available."It could give a lot of peace of mind for those of us who catch this, which most of us will, pending a vaccine," he said. "And for those of us who will go sideways, it could lead to early detection. And it will keep on giving to humankind."From a nursing perspective, the study could offer a lot in terms of treating patients, Bugajski said."It's really cool we're using big data to be able to alleviate symptoms," he said. "There's also a certain safety and calm of mind that comes with objective data. ... We're entering an age of precision medicine. This strengthens our ability to treat you as an individual."

A reforma administrativa poderia realizar uma restrutura\'e7\'e3o estatal, tornando-o mais sustent\'e1vel e desviando recursos, que hoje s\'e3o mal utilizados, para os servi\'e7os que realmente impactam o cidad\'e3o na ponta. Al\'e9m desta quest\'e3o, h\'e1 ainda uma outra urg\'eancia: a de repensar o funcionalismo p\'fablico no Brasil. O pa\'eds est\'e1 entre os maiores no n\'famero de servidores, com sal\'e1rios muito acima da m\'e9dia do mercado, que congelam o or\'e7amento p\'fablico.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I have advanced cancer. Stage 4 lung cancer, to be exact, even though I have never smoked, and I am only 48 years old. Cancer is scary enough, but now I am in a real unknown, with so many others like me: dealing with advanced cancer in a pandemic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Don't get me wrong. For me personally, the pandemic has not been all bad. For a mother with terminal cancer, the lockdown has given me time I could never imagine having with my busy kids. A hidden gift in the madness.Although cancer will end my life, I still have some time, and dammit, I want it. And that means not getting infected. The studies so far indicate that cancer, especially lung cancer, puts patients at exceptionally high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19.Protecting my health therefore means staying home, even as states begin to lift their shelter-in-place orders. Since the outbreak began, I've canceled all but my most essential medical appointments. I still worry each time I head to the infusion center. I am not alone with this worry. An alarming number of patients are avoiding emergency rooms and doctor's offices, even when they urgently need care.If patients continue to miss treatments and screenings, our healthcare system could easily see another wave of emergencies when the coronavirus crisis begins to wane. In the New York City Health+Hospitals system, emergency room visits dropped by 50 percent when the pandemic began. The problem has gotten so bad that public health officials have to remind people to call 911 or go to the ER if they're suffering a heart attack. In the Mass General Brigham health system, cardiovascular hospitalizations dropped by over 40 percent from March 2019 to March 2020, and in-hospital mortality was up -- indicating that patients who were admitted had more severe disease.The pandemic has also taken a severe toll on cancer treatments. Nearly 80 percent of cancer patients in active treatment have reported delays in their care, according to a survey from the American Cancer Society. One of my medications that I need and could obtain from compassionate use has been held up by the FDA for weeks now, due to COVID-19.Additionally, many new cancer cases will go undetected. In March, preventive screenings for breast, colon and cervical cancers dropped by up to 94 percent compared to the previous year. The number of visits from new oncology patients dropped by about 40 percent between February and April. The IQVIA Institute for Human 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  recently estimated that over 80,000 cancer diagnoses might be missed or delayed as a result of COVID-19.Delayed care will quickly become emergent care, creating a dangerous strain on our healthcare system if we don't act quickly. It has happened before. Researchers from Taiwan and Johns Hopkins found that hospital utilization for diabetes decreased during the SARS epidemic, only to soar after it was over. Cancer incidence in Hong Kong dropped in 2003, the year of the SARS outbreak, only to rebound significantly the following year. Researchers in Hong Kong are already calling on preparation for a transnational cancer crisis from COVID-19.We need to prepare for that second wave. That's why, right now, physicians must begin urging those who need medical treatment to receive the care they need, whether virtually or in-person.I understand how this delay of care can be as deadly as COVID-19 itself. In addition to being a cancer patient, I am also a practicing physician. Even before COVID-19, I treated my patients virtually. That made a huge difference when the pandemic hit. My patients all have diabetes or prediabetes, conditions that put them at a high risk of COVID-19 complications -- just like me. Connecting with them virtually meant that their care was never delayed.Virtual care during the pandemic has ramped up at a speed that would have been unbelievable in almost any other circumstances. But it is not enough, and progress is still threatened. Often, virtual care is still very "clunky," and there are some people it can't reach. Additionally, much of the eased regulations surrounding virtual care were only temporary. We need to expand remote monitoring, help everyone gain access, and ensure that regulations that block progress don't get reinstated.Of course, doctors can't do everything virtually. But by keeping many patients out of clinics and hospitals, virtual care reduces risk for those who need chemotherapy, infusions, and other in-person procedures.Health care needs many radical changes, and expanded virtual care is one of them. Let's keep moving forward with the technology that can keep people like me, and my patients, safe both during the pandemic and after.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is common to hear social media figures and pundits deride censorship on social media and other technology platforms. As I wrote in Towards 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , this threat is very real, especially during the COVID-19 public health crisis. However, the exaggeration of the threat plays into our society\'92s growing fondness for \'93grievance culture.\'94 The story goes: 1) high-profile person posts content online 2) platform-verified user reports the content as having \'93no factual basis\'94 or as \'93fake news\'94 3) platform reviews the complaint and removes the content for violating its overbroad Terms of Service or Community Guidelines, and 4) that person\'92s community complains about censorship of ideas. Rinse, wash, repeat.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This line of thinking has become all too common. We can continue down this path where everyone derides these platforms without providing any real solutions, but this will do no good for society. Instead, we can look to legal arguments in defense of freedom of speech. The possible success of such arguments may bolster the case for establishing new technology platforms that follow less arbitrary Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Is there a constitutional case for providing recourse, under the guise of freedom of speech, on these platforms? That answer appears to be no. Here is why:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Hudgens v. National Labor Relations Board, a majority of the Supreme Court held\'a0"While statutory or common law may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others, no such protection or redress is provided by the Constitution itself."\'a0In essence, the majority points to Congress to provide redress, because the Constitution is silent on this controversy between individuals and private corporations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Supreme Court\'92s 2019 ruling in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck provides an interesting analysis on the \'93state-action doctrine.\'94 According to the Supreme Court, the doctrine holds that a private entity may be a state actor if it functions in a capacity \'93traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.\'94 Specifically, the Court notes \'93to qualify as a traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning of our state-action precedents, the government must have traditionally and exclusively performed the function.\'94 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Our current societal dilemma brings a similar question to mind. If Twitter were to, hypothetically, remove the President\'92s tweets or even his account, he may likely be unable to sue Twitter for removing his content. After all, the court is likely to view a social media platform as not falling under the \'93state-action doctrine,\'94 which may raise further questions. A federal appeals court held that the President\'92s tweets constituted official statements so does this imply that the platform cannot remove the President\'92s tweets or accounts? Only time will tell.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Prager University v. Google addresses a very similar question. Namely, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that \'93despite YouTube\'92s ubiquity and its role as a public-facing platform, it remains a private forum, not a public forum subject to judicial scrutiny under the First Amendment.\'94 The court cites Manhattan Community Access Corp v. Halleck in stating that the Internet does not alter the \'93state-action doctrine.\'94 Prager University\'92s contention in this case is, ultimately, similar to the many complaints against these technology platforms. These platforms rely on enforcing the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, and as public companies have every right to \'93
\f1\b remove content that violates
\f2\b0  its Terms of Service, or restrict otherwise objectionable videos.\'94 As arbitrarily applied as these policies may seem, these companies are well within their rights.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Federal law affords these technology platforms with federal protections in the form of \'93broad immunity from liability for their users\'92 actions, as well as wide latitude to police content,\'94 writes The Wall Street Journal. President Trump and Congressional Republicans have long derided anti-conservative bias; this discussion has prompted the possible establishment of a panel \'93to review complaints of...bias on social media.\'94 The relative importance of this panel will be contingent upon its proposed solutions. Some members of Congress have proposed 1) repealing this federal immunity 2) using anti-monopoly laws to break up these entities and 3) a new 21st-century version of the Fairness Doctrine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Let\'92s assume that federal immunity is repealed and now these platforms become liable for content, making them subject to much more stringent policing. The possibility of serious infringement on free speech is much more likely, as these companies are forced to adopt overly restrictive rules on content creation. This is a very serious risk as trial lawyers would likely view this as an opportunity to score easy money from the deep-pocketed technology companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The legal question pertaining to internet censorship is unlikely to be addressed by courts. Instead, individuals, interest groups, and Congress can push for serious changes to how these platforms operate, but that assumes there is a broad census that things are broken. Americans are relying on technology platforms for their news at record rates, and technology platforms have provided the sort of competition to legacy news outlets that is necessary to ensure everyone has a voice.

\f2\fs20 The Wall Street Journal\'92s Gerald Seib writes, \'93democracy was never intended to be the neatest form of government.\'94 Social media provides everyday individuals with an opportunity to express themselves, while also demonstrating how fundamentally different each individual is. Internet activist Eli Pariser writes of Internet algorithms that \'93democracy relies on shared facts; instead, we\'92re being offered parallel but separate universes.\'94 This disturbing truth is realized when no common alignment exists on what is fact versus fiction.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Current law allows these platforms broad leeway for deciding what content is objectionable and what is not, even though the Constitution is silent. The fundamental question for our society is what degree of content filtering would we find acceptable. The market, not lawyers, will ultimately decide society\'92s preferred outcome for these technology platforms. Individual content creators, such as Joe Rogan, and consumers of content will drive the future of media consumption to platforms where the possibility of censorship will ultimately not prevail.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          <h3>As we approach the new school year, numerous polls continue to show a newfound interest in homeschooling. Perhaps it\'92s because parents are nervous about their children getting sick, or maybe they don\'92t like new regulations at school. </h3><p>Whatever the case, there is the potential for a major shift in the education landscape in Mississippi and across the nation.\'a0</p><p>New polling from Heart + Mind Strategies\'a0reveals that 16 percent of government school parents and 10 percent of private school parents are considering homeschooling. This is down slightly from a May peak as parents are closer to making an actual decision, but we could see a lot more homeschoolers this fall.</p><img src="

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 All to homeschool. Keep in mind that somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 students are homeschooled in Mississippi today.\'a0</p><p>Are you one of those families considering homeschooling? My wife and I (mostly my wife) will be going into our third year of homeschooling this fall. We\'92re no experts but wanted to share our thoughts for those considering or ready to make the switch.</p><p><strong>1. Deinstitutionalize</strong></p><p>Some call this de-schooling, but the thought is you need to get away from the traditional schooling mindset. The longer you\'92ve been in a traditional setting, the longer of a break you need to take.\'a0</p><p>But the idea is this: You\'92re probably used to a schedule, calendar, or even grades and will be tempted to bring this to your homeschooling. That\'92s fine, but you don\'92t need to. You have more than 40 or 60 minutes to tackle a subject one day. Or you could take less time. Or you could decide your child isn\'92t getting it and you need to take a break for a few months. Or buy different curriculum. You might like the idea of structure, but homeschooling is about having the freedom to doing what is best for your child to gain an appreciation for learning.\'a0</p><p>We\'92ll often get questions asking how long our homeschool day is. We\'92re not being flippant when we say it depends.\'a0The more flexible you are, the more you will like it. </p><p><strong>2. Play to your child\'92s strengths</strong></p><p>This is one of my favorite homeschooling benefits and should become yours. Especially as your children get older. What are they passionate about? Where do they excel? Homeschooling gives you the ability to play that up. It could be as simple as a book series they love or maybe they want to learn about how computers work.\'a0</p><p>This might sound silly at first glance, but YouTube has a world of informative videos that will teach you everything from A to Z on how to build computers, websites, or maybe just do graphic design or video editing. The opportunities expand the imagination of you and your child.\'a0</p><p><strong>3. Get out and explore</strong></p><p>Though many of our favorite places to visit have been closed or limited, take advantage of what is beyond your four walls. Sure, it could be your backyard \'96 a fun place to do school in the fall or spring \'96 but check out museums and zoos. When we go to Gulf Shores or Orange Beach, we still check out the zoo, the state park, or the historical sites. Sure, it\'92s education on vacation, but it\'92s still fun. And well worth it. And just to let you know, your local library will likely become your best friend very soon so plan on buying or building more bookcases.</p><p>When I was involved as sports as a kid, we had to run for punishment. Therefore, running isn\'92t something I do for fun as an adult. A lot of kids could have the same approach to learning. In the closed structure of a school, fun isn\'92t really something we\'92re supposed to take part in. Or that\'92s what we\'92re told. But we know it shouldn\'92t be that way. Explore. Make learning fun again.\'a0</p><p><strong>4. Find homeschool friends\'a0\'a0</strong></p><p>Homeschooling is the kind of thing you can do as privately or as publicly as you\'92d like. But for your own sanity, search out homeschool friends. This doesn\'92t mean you need get involved in a co-op, or something similar, but you certainly can.\'a0</p><p>But because of Facebook, you will likely find homeschooling groups. Even unofficial groups plan outings and field trips. If you\'92re the mom running the show, as is usually the case, find other moms. Keep up with them. Share your struggles. Get advice. Ask questions. Offer feedback. You don\'92t need to do this alone, unless you want to.\'a0</p><p><strong>5. Look for outside activities</strong></p><p>If you look around, you will find plenty of activities for your child. Yep, homeschoolers socialize. If you live in more of an urban area, it will naturally be easier for find such activities, but be on the lookout regardless. We do piano lessons from a local instructor who mostly serves homeschool students during the day. We also do P.E. at a local martial arts studio that offers the program for students during school hours.\'a0\'a0</p><p>These are some of the fun, social, and educational activities that are out there. What your child does is up to you and his or her interest.\'a0</p><p><strong>6. Don\'92t worry if everything isn\'92t perfect</strong></p><p>I would suggest you don\'92t go to Pinterest to get ideas on the perfect homeschool room or setup. Because there isn\'92t a perfect room. If you want your room to look a certain way, have at it, but it\'92s not that important in the grand scheme.\'a0</p><p>Instead, focus on the functional. We have a dedicated homeschool room, but it\'92s more of our office. Most of the instruction takes place on the dining room table with younger brothers gathering around. Maybe for you it\'92s the kitchen or living room or back porch. And even if you don\'92t have matching pillows or inspirational signs, everything will be okay.\'a0</p><p><strong>7. Take advantage of free online resources</strong></p><p>As we mentioned, YouTube is a great platform for educational videos on specific subjects of interest. But if you\'92re looking for more, free online learning resources, here is a comprehensive list from\'a0Kerry McDonald:</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>Khan Academy</strong>\'a0\'96\'a0Perhaps the leader in free, high??quality, online learning content for kids, Khan Academy offers no??cost YouTube instructional videos in a\'a0wide range of content areas, including all levels of mathematics, English language arts, science, history, computer science and programming, and SAT preparation.

Codecademy offers free access to basic lessons, with the option to pay for more advanced courses if your kids get really into it.</li><li><strong>Marginal Revolution University</strong><strong>\'a0(MRU)</strong>\'a0\'96\'a0Economics isn\'92t always taught at the K-12 level, but the dynamic, self??paced introductory economics courses offered for free through MRU are likely to pique your older child\'92s interest. These are also great classes for you to learn alongside your child.</li><li><strong>Lyn?da?.com</strong>\'a0\'96\'a0Available for free through many public libraries, Lyn?da?.com has an array of online learning resources in subject areas ranging from photography to business to web development. Check with your local library for access details, and while you\'92re at it, explore the many other digital resources your local library likely offers. Many public libraries provide free access to e??books, streaming films and music, digital magazines, and even language learning resources, such as\'a0Mango.</li><li><strong>TED</strong><strong>?</strong><strong>?Ed</strong>\'a0\'96\'a0TED??Ed offers a\'a0free suite of high??quality videos on a\'a0variety of topics for learners of all ages, including supplemental materials, discussion questions, and opportunities to probe deeper into areas of interest.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A dificuldade de diversos pa\'edses em lidar com a pandemia do novo coronav\'edrus trouxe \'e0 tona a discuss\'e3o de como ser\'e1 o futuro da sa\'fade. O tema foi motivo de debate na confer\'eancia online Brazil at Silicon Valley, realizada nesta quarta-feira (03/06). Participaram da conversa Sumant Ramachandra, presidente da Baxter Pharmaceuticals, e Carlos Bustamante, professor de Biomedical 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  da Universidade Stanford. O painel foi mediado por Anurag Mairal, professor da escola de medicina da Universidade Stanford.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Na conversa, os dois concordaram que a maior li\'e7\'e3o da pandemia at\'e9 agora foi mostrar que o futuro da sa\'fade ser\'e1 preventivo e hiperconectado.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Para Ramachandra, sistemas p\'fablicos de sa\'fade em mercados emergentes como o Brasil gastam muito dinheiro com o tratamento de doen\'e7as de baixa gravidade. \'93Se voc\'ea quer ajudar uma popula\'e7\'e3o, intervenha de maneira precoce e guarde seu dinheiro para os casos s\'e9rios\'94, afirma.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 O executivo acredita que a telemedicina pode ser uma ferramenta valiosa para o futuro do mercado de sa\'fade. \'93Voc\'ea deve tratar em casa o m\'e1ximo que puder. Os pacientes s\'e3o levados para o hospital muito rapidamente. \'c9 preciso agir de forma preventiva.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bustamante concorda. Na sua vis\'e3o, esse \'e9 o caminho \'96 e o Brasil tem agora a oportunidade de segui-lo com a aprova\'e7\'e3o provis\'f3ria da telemedicina. \'93Espero que n\'e3o voltem atr\'e1s, porque avan\'e7amos nesse sentido\'94, diz. Para o professor, esse tipo de ferramenta permite que profissionais da sa\'fade trabalhem com preven\'e7\'e3o e de forma ainda mais pr\'f3xima dos pacientes. N\'e3o s\'f3 no campo da sa\'fade f\'edsica, mas tamb\'e9m da sa\'fade mental. \'93A telemedicina vai ser um dos refor\'e7os mais importantes na batalha da sa\'fade mental temos travado nos \'faltimos anos. A covid-19 vai ser a porta para isso\'94, diz.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Outro ponto abordado pelos dois foi a conectividade. Para Bustamante, a pandemia deveria ensinar ao mundo o valor do trabalho em conjunto. \'93Temos de compartilhar dados. Essa \'e9 a mensagem importante de tudo isso. Quando aprendemos algo sobre a doen\'e7a, temos de partilhar.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ramachandra pensa da mesma forma. Para o executivo, h\'e1 um oceano de dados a ser explorado. Ele cita como exemplo o caso de uma Unidade de Tratamento Intensivo (UTI). \'93H\'e1 monitoramento de v\'e1rios lados, dados sendo coletados por diversas empresas. Como cruz\'e1-los e correlacion\'e1-los, para trabalhar com preven\'e7\'e3o? Esse \'e9 o desafio.\'94 Sobre intelig\'eancia artificial, ele \'e9 categ\'f3rico. \'93Ela n\'e3o vai substituir o m\'e9dico. Mas quem n\'e3o us\'e1-la ser\'e1 substitu\'eddo no futuro.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 While many heroic doctors, nurses and other health care professionals are working long hours and risking their lives to treat COVID-19 patients, others have seen their workloads and hospital occupancy rates drop dramatically as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. This has created a financial crisis and endangered public health.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, public health officials urged hospitals to suspend non-essential medical procedures. U.S. hospitals canceled tens of thousands of elective surgeries and other procedures, and urged patients to make use of telehealth.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Americans adapted quickly to this new reality. Doctor visits declined nearly 60 percent from March to April \'96 a stunning amount, according to a new Commonwealth Fund study. Some of the largest drop-offs occurred in surgery and pediatric care. Telehealth visits increased slightly, but not enough to offset the overall drop in care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With no patients to treat, a number of hospitals are in dire financial straits as they see massive drops in their incomes. The American Hospital Association estimates hospitals are losing more than $50 billion per month due to the COVID-19 slowdown. That could force 100 hospitals to close within a year, according to a USA Today analysis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Physicians are in a similar predicament. Only half of primary care physicians have enough cash on hand to survive another four weeks, according to a survey from the Primary Care Collective.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 COVID-19 is expected to push up to 60,000 family medicine doctors out of their practices by June.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As revenues continue to decline by huge amounts, physicians have little choice but to sell their practices to hospitals, insurance companies, or private equity groups. Such consolidation could make it harder for patients to access care and would cause health care costs to increase further.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The good news for hospitals and medical professionals is that as states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, hospitals are trying to return to normal. Earlier this month, 20 states green-lit the resumption of elective surgeries that had been postponed to preserve personal protective equipment and other resources for the response to COVID-19.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But even without government restrictions on elective surgeries, fear of the coronavirus may keep patients away from hospitals for some time. Nearly half of doctors believe patient visits will only return to pre-COVID-19 levels sometime between July and September.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 By that point, patients and providers alike will have suffered real losses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Patients who stay away from the hospital and put off necessary care risk dying prematurely. Without people to treat, physician practices and hospitals are losing money. Many could soon shut down.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These are some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic. Our leaders must keep them in mind as they work to resurrect the economy in the weeks and months to come.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fear of the coronavirus and confusion over stay-at-home orders have caused even the sickest patients to avoid hospitals. Emergency room visits are down 50 percent across New York City\'92s Health and Hospitals System. Admissions for a certain type of heart attack fell nearly 40 percent in nine major hospitals across eight states in March.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The data suggest that even patients experiencing medical emergencies are staying home. Things have gotten so bad that the American Heart Association joined seven other medical groups to remind people to call 911 and go to the hospital if they fear they\'92ve had a heart attack or stroke.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Interruptions of medical care are taking their toll on patients. Those awaiting hip replacements spend their days in pain, struggling to move. Some doctors have postponed surgeries aimed at addressing early-stage cancer. The longer these \'93elective\'94 surgeries are postponed, the more people suffer.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Patients in need of treatment aren\'92t the only ones at risk. The COVID-19 lockdown could lead to 22 million canceled or delayed tests for five common cancers by June, according to a new report by the IQVIA Institute for Human 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . This reduction in testing could lead to 80,000 missed cancer diagnoses.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The same report found that colonoscopies dropped 90 percent between February and April; mammograms dropped 87 percent. New visits for cancer patients declined nearly 40 percent over the same period, while cancellations and no-shows nearly doubled.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Such widespread suspensions of medical care may not have been necessary. The pandemic has not hit our country evenly. While the New York City metropolitan area has been hit hard, many hospitals outside COVID-19 hotspots have been practically empty for the past few months.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After months of lockdown, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health crisis in more ways than one. While it\'92s critically important to focus our attention on the deadly pandemic, we have to keep hospitals, outpatient clinics and health care professionals financially solvent so they are there to provide treatment and preventive care for our other important medical needs.

\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 N\'e3o bastasse a C\'e2mara ter aprovado uma compensa\'e7\'e3o tribut\'e1ria para Estados e Munic\'edpios\'97 como se a Uni\'e3o tamb\'e9m n\'e3o fosse ter perda de arrecada\'e7\'e3o\'97 os deputados derrubaram a \'fanica contrapartida proposta pelo Governo Federal para aprova\'e7\'e3o desta ajuda bilion\'e1ria: congelamento salarial de 18 meses para os servidores p\'fablicos. A economia que era estimada em 130 bi foi desidratada em 65,3%, para cerca de 40 bilh\'f5es. Isso porque algumas categorias ficaram de fora.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Em reuni\'e3o com governadores nesta semana, Bolsonaro afirmou que vai vetar o reajuste salarial de servidores. No entanto, a demora no veto possibilitou que alguns governos estaduais aprovassem aumentos que j\'e1 estavam em negocia\'e7\'e3o. O presidente tem at\'e9 o dia 27 de maio para sancionar o projeto.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 O fato \'e9 que, o governo federal precisar\'e1 aumentar ainda mais a d\'edvida bruta, que dever\'e1 chegar em 90% do PIB, para obter recursos que provenham trabalhadores informais, desempregados e para o financiamento da sa\'fade p\'fablica.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 S\'f3 o montante que seria economizado sem cortes, apenas proibindo aumentos, evidencia a urg\'eancia de uma Reforma Administrativa. Um estudo in\'e9dito sobre o tema, feito em parceria com o Instituto Millenium e a consultoria de 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Octahedron (ODX), que ser\'e1 lan\'e7ado ainda este ano, apontou que o n\'edvel salarial m\'e9dio de funcion\'e1rio p\'fablico federal de n\'edvel superior em in\'edcio de carreira \'e9 de R$ 10.410,76. Nem mesmo categorias normalmente bem remuneradas no setor privado, como engenheiros, chegam pr\'f3ximos \'e0 metade desse valor com pouca experi\'eancia de mercado.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Ainda que um concurso p\'fablico seja concorrido, a prepara\'e7\'e3o necess\'e1ria para vencer uma prova n\'e3o \'e9 lastro de produtividade, ali\'e1s, o estudo indica que 95% dos funcion\'e1rios p\'fablicos federais recebem o m\'e1ximo de bonifica\'e7\'e3o de desempenho, o detalhe: inexistem crit\'e9rios objetivos de avalia\'e7\'e3o para conceder tal benef\'edcio.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Esta realidade os coloca, segundo o estudo, entre os 6% mais ricos do Brasil, o que, levando-se em conta a regressividade dos Tributos, pode-se dizer que o Estado brasileiro distribui riquezas\'85 s\'f3 que \'e0s avessas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Enfim, at\'e9 onde se sabe, o Coronav\'edrus e a crise econ\'f4mica por ele causada n\'e3o fazem distin\'e7\'e3o entre categorias e segmentos, um fato que todos sabem, mas alguns fingem que n\'e3o enxergam.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 New York finally has seen the light.\'a0\'a0The state on Sunday\'a0reversed its deadly mandate, issued in March, prohibiting nursing homes from testing incoming residents and requiring them to accept patients from hospitals, even if they were diagnosed with COVID-19. New York now says hospitals can send patients to nursing homes only if they have tested negative for the virus.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The March 25 New York directive read in part:\'a0\'a0\'93No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to [a nursing home] based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\'94\'a0The original intent was to free up beds in hospitals expecting a surge of coronavirus patients.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These facilities had become hothouses for infection. After massive public criticism and mounting deaths, New York reversed its position\'97but without officially acknowledging its error.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 \'93The state has failed to protect the lives of the most vulnerable
\f2\b0 \'a0members of our community,\'94 Ron Kim, a Democratic member of the state Assembly,\'a0told\'a0The Wall Street Journal. \'93The fact we maintained and pushed COVID-positive patients into facilities that were not equipped to handle them, it was a fatal error.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nursing-home residents, who are typically frail and live in close quarters, are particularly vulnerable\'a0to the virus, yet nursing homes were not a priority during the peak of the pandemic, with pleas for protective equipment and tests\'a0often ignored.\'a0\'a0New York officials did not heed earlier entreaties from the AARP, nursing organizations, and others to reverse the deadly order.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93If we had focused on that early on,\'94 said state Assemblyman Ron Kim, the Queens Democrat, \'93we could have saved a lot of lives.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 New York was not alone. Other states, including California and New Jersey, issued\'a0similar directives\'a0to\'a0nursing homes\'a0saying they must not refuse to take patients from hospitals solely because they have the\'a0coronavirus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While reporting is uneven, nationwide, more than\'a030,000 coronavirus deaths\'a0have been tied to long-term care facilities.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93
\f1\b The way this has been handled
\f2\b0 \'a0by the state is totally irresponsible, negligent and stupid,\'94 Elaine Mazzotta, a nurse whose mother died last month of suspected COVID-19 at a Long Island, NY, nursing home,\'a0told PBS. \'93They knew better. They shouldn\'92t have sent these people into nursing homes.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As we reported here last week, the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity\'a0estimates\'a0that at least 40% of all deaths from COVID-19 are residents of long-term care facilities.\'a0\'a0When New York\'92s questionable numbers are excluded, the number jumps to 51%.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 The policy conclusion here could not be clearer
\f2\b0 :\'a0\'a0Our attention MUST be focused on caring for the most vulnerable who are most at risk, and all of the data say that should be elderly Americans, especially those with co-morbidities, who are most likely to be in long-term care facilities.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Then we can begin to open the economy for millions of other Americans who are struggling mightily with how they are going to care for their families, keep their jobs, and save their businesses.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 And importantly, doctors and hospitals
\f2\b0 \'a0can get back to their core business of taking care of patients, especially those who have been denied care because of the moratorium on non-COVID treatments.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Washington Examiner\'a0reports:\'a0\'a0\'93One patient of mine has a ruptured disk and a pinched nerve, but she\'92s not an emergency case, so she\'92s had to wait over three months for surgery,\'94 said Dr. John Dietz, an orthopedic surgeon at OrthoIndy near Indianapolis. \'93She\'92s in her late 30s trying to deal with three young children at home while also trying to deal with lots of pain in her legs.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 O termo popularmente usado para o aux\'edlio emergencial concedido pelo governo est\'e1 sendo contestado por alguns economistas porque coloca um prazo na ajuda econ\'f4mica dada aos trabalhadores independentes afetados pelas duas crises: a de sa\'fade e a econ\'f4mica, causada pela Covid-19.\'a0Importante lembrar que essa ajuda \'e9 uma distribui\'e7\'e3o de impostos e tarifas. Dinheiro que foi arrecadado para o funcionamento da m\'e1quina e investimentos para a sociedade. Quando se afunila essa verba para superar um problema urgente, falta dinheiro para as pol\'edticas p\'fablicas \'96 como educa\'e7\'e3o, seguran\'e7a e sa\'fade \'96 que constitucionalmente s\'e3o financiadas pelos nossos tributos.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Interessante que, em um passado recente, as al\'edquotas tribut\'e1rias mantiveram-se no mesmo patamar e, apesar da alta carga tribut\'e1ria, o dinheiro que havia no \'93caixa\'94 n\'e3o foi empregado adequadamente para estruturar servi\'e7os b\'e1sicos, como os j\'e1 citados educa\'e7\'e3o, sa\'fade e seguran\'e7a. A desigualdade social existe h\'e1 muitos anos e n\'e3o foi nem sequer melhorada por planejamento or\'e7ament\'e1rio ou com prazos para poder evitar corrup\'e7\'e3o nos repasses. Qualquer transfer\'eancia de verba deve ser fiscalizada e ter uma dura\'e7\'e3o planejada.\'a0 Isso n\'e3o quer dizer que sejam necess\'e1rios mil carimbos e dezenas de partidos ou servidores p\'fablicos. Na realidade, \'e9 preciso haver um come\'e7o, meio e fim para fazer sentido, o que pode ser feito de forma digital e transparente.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Sal\'e1rios e benef\'edcios de servidores p\'fablicos e pol\'edticos continuaram a aumentar e nenhum partido ou l\'edder achou complicada a desigualdade de renda entre os setores p\'fablico e privado nos \'faltimos 12 anos. Em estudo sobre o tema feito pelo projeto Millenium Analisa, em parceria com a consultoria de 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ODX e que ser\'e1 lan\'e7ado este ano, foi constatado que, para alcan\'e7ar o mesmo patamar do funcionalismo, a m\'e9dia salarial dos trabalhadores do setor privado deveria crescer quase 60%. Al\'e9m disso, a m\'e9dia de rendimento dos servidores federais, que ultrapassa os R$ 10 mil, os coloca entre os 6,6% mais ricos da popula\'e7\'e3o.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As estatais continuaram a receber dinheiro sem transforma\'e7\'e3o digital, inova\'e7\'e3o e elimina\'e7\'e3o de cargos in\'fateis. Ainda segundo o estudo, em 2019 os mais de 605 mil funcion\'e1rios federais civis custaram R$ 319 bilh\'f5es. O montante \'e9 21 vezes maior do que os recursos investidos em saneamento, por exemplo, que n\'e3o \'e9 importante apenas para sa\'fade, sobretudo em momentos de crise \'96 este setor tamb\'e9m interfere no desempenho escolar dos alunos, como mostrou o segundo estudo produzido pelo projeto Millenium Analisa sobre educa\'e7\'e3o.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Em 2019, uma nova mentalidade invadiu o Legislativo e o Minist\'e9rio da Economia. Grandes esfor\'e7os de planejamento e reformas foram feitos mesmo com uma m\'e1quina engessada e autoprotegida. Muita discuss\'e3o \'e9 tida sobre quem protege os pobres e quem protege os ricos, mas na verdade os tempos mudaram e a desigualdade no pa\'eds est\'e1 entre o setor p\'fablico e a sociedade.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Em um m\'eas, v\'e1rios t\'e9cnicos trouxeram propostas l\'f3gicas para combater as crises vividas agora. Por que os partidos n\'e3o est\'e3o sacrificando seus slogans e sal\'e1rios junto com os brasileiros? Bom lembrar que ainda n\'e3o h\'e1 um consenso sobre o uso dos fundos partid\'e1rio e eleitoral, que somam R$ 3 bilh\'f5es, no combate ao coronav\'edrus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Na hora da elei\'e7\'e3o, os brasileiros ver\'e3o muitos pol\'edticos batendo na tecla de que votaram pelo aux\'edlio emergencial. Mas esse dinheiro veio de cortes em sal\'e1rios, benef\'edcios e cargos ou do endividamento e realoca\'e7\'e3o de verbas do Estado? Como resolver a desigualdade e manter o aux\'edlio em um pa\'eds onde a pol\'edtica n\'e3o vive a realidade brasileira? S\'f3 o tempo nos dir\'e1.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 BERKELEY, Calif., Mar 10, 2020 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) - Berkeley Coding Academy, a new computer science team of credentialed teachers, is offering summer camps to empower youth in Python Programming, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Machine Learning has not been an option for middle school and high school students until now. Machine Learning is the ability of computers to make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed. More importantly, Machine Learning allows systems to problem-solve and refine themselves again and again, making it the most valuable skill in the economy today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Corey Wade, chair of the math department at Berkeley Independent Study and lead author of "The Python Workshop," developed BCA to bring Machine Learning to a wider and younger audience. A multiple grant award winner, Wade has run after school coding clubs with students to create iPhone Apps, design websites, and analyze big data. Wade realized that bringing Machine Learning to the high school curriculum, however, was a slow process. The urgency and potential of high school students to become acquainted with Machine Learning inspired Wade to start BCA right away.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 BCA partnered with Hands-On!, Berkeley's first STEAM lab run by credentialed teacher Tracy Hollander. Hands-On! provides STEAM camps during summer for ages 5-11. BCA will provide Machine Learning & AI camps at the same location for ages 12-18. All instructors at BCA and Hands-On! are Berkeley credentialed teachers with deep experiences in the classroom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to Wade, "Many talented people understand Machine Learning, but very few teach Machine Learning to high school students. It's definitely a challenge. When I look at what my students accomplish in math, I know they can learn Machine Learning. Our students, given the right guidance and motivation, can do anything."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What makes BCA special is that Bay Area middle school and high school students now have the rare opportunity to learn Machine Learning & AI with an experienced and passionate teacher.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Here are 5 facts about Machine Learning & AI in the world today, from Finances Online. (
\f3\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 https://financesonline.com/machine-learning-statistics/
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone )
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 1. 80% of companies plan to adopt AI for customer service by 2020. (oracle.com)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 2. 97% of mobile users use AI-powered voice assistants. (creativestrategies.com)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 3. $28.5 billion - The total funding allocated to machine learning worldwide during the first quarter of 2019. (statista.com)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 4. $13 trillion - The potential global economy that AI could deliver by 2030. (mckinsey.com)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 5. 74% of companies say ML will transform jobs and industries. (memsql.com)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Here are 5 reasons why Bay Area students should enroll in a Machine Learning & AI summer camp with BCA.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 1. Machine Learning is a game-changer - Students who build Machine Learning models will gain an edge. Machine Learning is usually reserved for upper division college students, graduates, and 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  professionals. BCA changes the status quo by making Machine Learning available to teens.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 2. Big data is bigger than ever - BCA students learn how to program in Python and analyze big data. Using Python to analyze big data is the work of a data analyst and typically commands a large salary.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 3. Friendships and mentorships can transform lives - Learning from and working with like-minded peers can help solidify technical skills and forge lifelong friendships. Moreover, BCA encourages developing relationships with mentors, potentially leading to exciting opportunities that extend beyond summer.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 4. Limitless opportunities for social impact - Working with big data and coding in Python is valuable to many people. Opportunities to help others in camp will arise, and opportunities to help local communities may surface.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 5. BCA teaches professional coding skills through "real-world" datasets - The code that BCA teaches is the real deal. It's the same code used by professional data scientists.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 After only a few months of a quick global spread of the Wuhan China virus (\'93COVID-19\'94), evidence is mounting that it won\'92t prove as deadly as first projected; yet there\'92s still a high level of hysteria and an ominous spread of deleterious economic and public health policies, amounting to incarceration, monetization, and nationalization. What\'92s needed instead \'96 if health and wealth are desired \'96 is deregulation, tax relief, and capitalism.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s good news that some \'93red tape\'94 has been removed to allow drug makers and health care pros to better (and more freely) do their jobs. That can improve and solve things, but it shouldn\'92t take an emergency for people to have more liberty, and the real problem today is the reverse: liberties are being lost out of an irrational obsession with safety and security, with a puerile need for a \'93social safety net\'94 immunizing us from every change and risk.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This phobia has led Mr. Trump and his team to close borders and declare \'93war\'94 in peacetime, which means to declare war against citizens, even invoking a never-repealed Defense Production Act (1950) that gives the executive branch vast power to commandeer resources, nationalize industries, and impose wage-price controls.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tragically, bipartisan support exists for this approach. This week the governors of California and New York \'96 each of whom is a Democrat eyeing the prize of a future White House gig \'96 mandated near-complete shutdowns of nearly all social-productive activity in their regal realms, including \'93non-essential business.\'94 They and other state governors also want to use the National Guard, while mayors of major cities (Los Angeles, New York, etc.) impose curfews and adopt measures that are akin to martial law. Meanwhile, many officials are emptying prisons and refusing to fully enforce laws against shoplifting.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s well known that one side of the American bipartisan divide (Republican) favors policies reflecting nationalism while the other side (Democrat) favors policies reflecting socialism.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That\'92s the case here too, in dealing with COVID-19. Sometimes the two sides clash, but we also all observe them finding common ground. A synthesis of the two, if you know your history, would be national socialism. Look it up and see whether it\'92s really something you want or, regardless, whether it\'92s something you\'92ll eventually get.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Initially, according to an influential but catastrophist study from London Imperial College, which was widely promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 was estimated to have a global death rate of 3.4% for those eventually infected, peaking in mid-2020. But that high estimate came from a mere hypothetical model based solely on China\'92s early, most intense experience with COVID-19.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Even if the actual, future global death rate of the virus becomes ten times the 0.1% historical death rate for those who contract the common flu each season, it would be 1.0%, or roughly 1/3rd of the 3.4% estimate. Even the New York Times, prone to sensationalizing COVID-19 out of political bias, reported recently that \'93Coronavirus Death Rate in Wuhan is Lower Than Previously Thought.\'94\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Globally, so far, Johns Hopkins University reports 255,305 cases of COVID-19 infections, with 157,510 of those (62%) unresolved, 87,351 (34%) recovered, and 10,444 (4%) ending in death. Many of those who\'92ve died were older folks and/or those with pre-existing conditions (diabetes, heart and respiratory diseases, etc.). Very little attention has been paid to the fact that there are many survivors, probably because it\'92s not sensationalist enough; yet epidemiologists say survivors provide valuable data for determining optimal treatment. Most of those who recovered weren\'92t spending their prior weeks in self-exile or home hibernation, as public officials now demand; older people are more likely to live alone.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 An informative, compelling scientific analysis of COVID-19 was issued recently by Dr. John Ioannidis, professor of medicine, epidemiology and population health, of biomedical 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , and of statistics at Stanford University, and co-director of its Meta-Research Innovation Center. He contends that the COVID-19 event is a potential \'93fiasco in the making,\'94 because decisions today, public and private alike, are not sufficiently based on reliable evidence or sound science, and the evidence suggests strongly that this is a virus likely to generate far less dire effects than many now believe. For Ioannidis:
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio [of COVID-19] in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%. . . If 1% of the U.S. population gets infected (about 3.3 million people), this would translate to about 10,000 deaths. This sounds like a huge number, but it is buried within the noise of the estimate of deaths from \'93influenza-like illness. If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to \'91influenza-like illness\'92 would not seem unusual this year. At most, we might have casually noted that the flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average. The media coverage would have been less than for an NBA game between the two most indifferent teams.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 (See also his paper \'93Why Most Published Research Findings Are False,\'94 cited more than 8,000 in the literature.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Consider some other recent context. The H1N1 virus (aka \'93swine flu\'94) originated in Mexico in March 2009 and by mid-March of 2010 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 59 million Americans were infected; of that, only 265,000 (0.4%) were hospitalized while 12,000 died. The death rate from H1N1 (0.02%, or total deaths divided by total infected) was twice the long-term average death rate of the common flu, but still miniscule.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As of today, the U.S. has 17,962 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 239 deaths from it, a fatality of 1.3%. Certainly, the case count will rise, perhaps by a lot, but to anything close to 59 million? Unlikely. COVID-19 isn\'92t yet like the H1N1 virus, although it\'92s now 1/3rd as old.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2009-10, the media infrequently and quietly covered the \'93swine flu;\'94 there was no widespread phobia, no government bans on peaceful assembly, no shutdowns of economic activity, no stock-price crash.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Given the impeachment hysteria of 2018-20 and the partisan motives that drove it, perhaps the main difference between the mild reaction to the more lethal H1NI virus in 2010 and the hyped, heated reaction to the Wuhan China virus in 2020 is the difference between President Obama, who was adored by most of the media, and President Trump, who, we know, is reviled by most of it.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 AIER has been an important, sober, and objective source of evidence, analysis, and context for COVID-19, tracking and reporting the vital information which seems lost on the sensationalists in media and the power-seekers in politics. It\'92s also been careful to consider a full context, not just the bio-medical aspects but also the social, economic, financial, and political aspects. It knows we mustn\'92t be myopic.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other good sources include Johns Hopkins University and Our World in Data. I\'92m an economist and political scientist, not an epidemiologist or virologist, but I also know that data and models can be manipulated by credentialed ideologies seeking to grind an axe or push a pre-virus agenda.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There\'92s good reason to believe that such manipulation is happening with COVID-19, and even if it is a minor factor, it\'92s a major factor if heavily relied upon by public officials wielding political power and imposing potentially harmful policies on millions of people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Now let\'92s briefly examine the three main public (and private) policy approaches to the arrival of COVID-19 in America: incarceration, monetization, and nationalization.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Incarceration
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To \'93incarcerate\'94 means to imprison people who are guilty and justly convicted of legally criminal acts. That\'92s not quite what\'92s happening now, but it isn\'92t far from the truth either. The policy now spreading nationwide is called \'93lockdown,\'94 a prison term; some call it \'93shelter in place,\'94 which seems less harsh, but isn\'92t if it\'92s enforced or its disobedience is penalized. The technique of \'93house arrest\'94 incarcerates people in their abode and restricts their freedom of movement, but such people nonetheless have been convicted of criminal acts, and if they violate the conditions of their home confinement, they risk more severe imprisonment. Today, in contrast, we\'92re witnessing a near-universal house arrest of innocents, of people presumed to be guilty (i.e., infected, thus dangerous to others) unless they can prove their innocence, which is a direct contravention of fair jurisprudence; moreover, this is happening without much complaint, opposition or civil disobedience.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A nationwide government mandate of near-universal house arrest is not only a brazen assault on civil liberties, but also on economic liberties, for it violates the freedom to peaceably assemble, to associate, to produce in groups at firms, to interact, exchange, trade, profit, and prosper. It undermines the confidence people might have in the intelligence, integrity, and poise of their leaders; it makes the future more difficult to predict, thus freezing activity, and more difficult even than predicting the future path of the familiar, bell-shaped disease curve. As such, it erodes the preservation of both wealth and health, not to mention sabotaging people\'92s natural and healthy desire to socialize, entertain, recreate and \'93refuel.\'94 It\'92s certainly no solution to the problem of COVID-19.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There\'92s some common sense, of course, in identifying, testing, and treating the infected, if necessary even to declare publicly that people will be held liable if they know they\'92re sick and yet knowingly interact with and jeopardize the health and life of others. Quarantines are justified if selective and fact-based, even for restricting entry from those arriving from suspect areas; but to indiscriminately quarantine everyone is unjust, impractical, and destructive. For COVID-19 already, death rates are low and recoveries high, so there\'92s good evidence that, like prior viruses, human interaction (not \'93social distancing\'94) may help us develop antibodies and immunities, all of which is lost if we\'92re forcibly confined to homes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Is there also no possible manifestation here of the law of unintended consequences? Consider only the possible viral effects of compelling millions of college students, just back from intensely congregating during \'93spring break,\'94 to board thousands of airplanes to go home and intermingle with parents and grandparents. The young can carry a virus with low infection rates, but the elderly are highly vulnerable; COVID-19 death rates are high in Italy partly because of its socialized medicine (which limits the system\'92s capacity, quality and responsiveness) but also because it has one of the world\'92s oldest populations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Monetization
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Monetization, another policy adopted in the wake of the arrival of COVID-19 entails the U.S. government (the Fed, Treasury, and various agencies) printing, borrowing, and spending vast sums of money \'96 $1-2 trillion at latest count \'96 on firms lacking sufficient revenues only because employees and customers were told to vacate and hibernate, and on citizens who\'92ve been dismissed from jobs and now do little or nothing at home (its untrue that \'93everyone can work from home\'94 or that those doing so work as productively).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since when does the mere creation of money \'96 especially unbacked, inconvertible fiat money \'96 create employment, wealth or prosperity? It doesn\'92t; it can\'92t; it only means that real wealth is being redistributed arbitrarily, not created freely and objectively. Wealth, we should all know by now, isn\'92t multiplied by dividing it, nor by rearranging it via monetary manipulations. In fact, these manipulations make production less likely, because the bias of issuance, including through public lending, is towards subsidizing and rewarding the illiquid and/or insolvent, at the expense of betters. Money represents wealth; it is not itself wealth. Is this so difficult to grasp?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Consider also the policy of zero interest rates, now almost universally adopted by major central banks; everyone seems convinced that this should \'93stimulate\'94 the economy by stimulating borrowing; ignored is the supply side of credit markets, and the lack of incentive for creditors to lend when they aren\'92t compensated. Is this difficult to grasp? Moreover, should firms and people borrow more when they\'92re shut down and making less or no money? The Keynesians love the zero-interest-rate policy, which is a major reason we\'92re seeing it adopted; they say it entails a welcome \'93euthanasia of the rentier\'94 (the despised lender); now watch, as it also euthanizes the economy and credit markets.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Likewise, issuing more public debt and placing it on an already-indebted economy compelled to produce less is irresponsible and self-defeating. More leverage means more debt relative to equity or net worth; more leverage is certainly not more wealth. Is this difficult to grasp? There is also no so-called \'93government spending multiplier,\'94 despite what Keynesians like Paul Krugman have been claiming and preaching for decades. There\'92s no magic wand whereby a dollar spent by politicians in the public sector creates wealth relative to what producers achieve in the private sector by spending the same dollar. Such mystical powers \'93exist\'94 only in Potterism, not in capitalism (or reality).\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not only does the issuance of fake money and debt create no real wealth, but those who believe it does so also seem to believe that wealth creation itself is a \'93problem\'94 to be \'93solved\'94 by curbing or stopping it. This is the Keynesian myth that economic recessions reflect \'93deficient demand,\'94 which allegedly results from previous \'93overproduction.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So-called \'93general glut theorists\'94 have been around for centuries, at least since the non-scientific Reverend Malthus (in the late 1700s) and persists to this day despite repeated refutations (by J.B. Say, Frederic Bastiat, Henry Hazlitt, etc.). It\'92s incredible that anyone today would still believe it, especially in today\'92s context; is the arrival of COVID-19 proof that the world previously \'93overproduced?\'94 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Yet the U.S. Secretary of Energy recently said that he and Mr. Trump were trying to reduce oil output, to boost the oil price. Similar policies, adopted in the early 1930s, transformed a recession into a multi-year Great Depression. Most notably, FDR\'92s New Deal AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Administration) paid farmers not to produce, even to burn crops, slaughter farm animals, and pour milk down drains \'97 all to boost agriculture prices and keep the supply-side in business. Meanwhile the demand side of the market, the millions of consumers suffering in bread lines and soup kitchens, faced mass unemployment (25%, peak, 1933), due to a similar Keynesian scheme of keeping prices (wage rates) artificially high.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nationalization
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Finally, consider the growing calls for the U.S. government to nationalize and/or control American businesses, in whole or part, allegedly to fight COVID-19. This is the hoped-for policy of the likes of avowed anti-capitalists Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but now Mr. Trump also wants to wield the power. He\'92s perfectly comfortable with it.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This week Mr. Trump invoked the Defense Production Act (1950), not to fight a war but to fight a virus, which is odd, because virus fighting should be the job of chemists, virologists, and epidemiologists.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What motivates this? The DPA gives the U.S. executive branch near-limitless power to impose wage-price controls, commandeer private resources, and nationalize firms and industries. The DPA neither cures a virus nor boosts investor confidence. It doesn\'92t create wealth but destroys it. It says when times are tough, policy should be based on emotion, coercion, and socialism, not on reason, incentives, and capitalism. President Truman used the DPA, but it didn\'92t help the U.S. win the Korean War.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The scheme of government in the U.S. taking shares or board seats in companies sometimes relates only to the policy of publicly subsidizing or bailing them out. But the subsidies and bailouts are themselves unjustified; two wrongs don\'92t make a right. Is this difficult to grasp?\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other people argue that the subsidies and bailouts are warranted if the illiquidity, insolvency and failures are due mainly to the government\'92s policy of mandating closures. But that policy is itself unjustified; again, two wrongs don\'92t make a right. We also hear that firms receiving government financial aid or loans shouldn\'92t be free to pay executives as they wish, nor be free to pay their shareholders, whether by dividends or share buybacks.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Yes, being a creditor or owner of a firm implies some control, but government bailouts, as mentioned, are unjustified, as is the policy of government ownership, and so also is the policy of decreeing how a firm shall be managed or how its executives and shareholders should be paid. Is this difficult to grasp?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When these three policies take hold, production plummets, and the full carnage is finally tallied, just watch as the culprits are again held blameless, indeed, extolled, as they were in 2008-09, as they insist (as they did then) that things would have been worse had their policies not been adopted.\'a0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the span of a few days, coronavirus has upended American higher education. More than 400 colleges have canceled classes or moved them online to slow the virus\'92s spread. While some schools hope that the shift will be temporary, others have confirmed that in-person classes and events will be canceled for the rest of the semester.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The nationwide closures mark what could easily be the most massive and sudden shake-up of higher education to date. For many students and faculty alike, the swift switch to online learning has cast dramatic uncertainty on the rest of the school year.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The uniting theme of university announcements last week has been one of proactive precaution. As university leaders monitor the evolving risk of coronavirus outbreaks hitting their campuses, many have made decisions motivated by concerns that an on-campus outbreak would overwhelm local health facilities, especially as supplies of masks and coronavirus test kits remain low.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Locally, the University of North Carolina system, Duke University, and Elon University have all canceled in-person classes and shifted to online learning.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ohio State University president Michael Drake recognized that while the university\'92s switch to online instruction will present a \'93Herculean task,\'94 he and other administrators felt an urgent need to act before the virus hit campus.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We had a choice here really of doing all we could to try to mitigate the damage of the virus before we had someone become very sick or unfortunately die, or we could wait until after that happened to do the most that we could, and we wanted to be ahead of that,\'94 he said at a press conference on Tuesday.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While many schools are allowing students to stay on campus as classes move online, they have noted that plans to resume in-person instruction this semester are only tentative. For example, the University of Virginia announced on Wednesday that it will run its classes online until at least April 5, and cautioned that the cancellation of in-person classes will last \'93quite possibly through the end of the semester.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other schools, including Harvard and MIT, have already decided to stick to online instruction for the rest of the semester and have asked students to move out of their dorms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most schools that have asked students to leave have noted that exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for students who cannot go home due to extenuating circumstances. However, orders to vacate on short notice have left students scrambling to make plans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s been a lot of tumult, it\'92s been a lot of chaos,\'94 said Chase Reid, a sophomore studying economics at MIT. He was surprised when the school ordered students to leave their dorms so quickly: The announcement was made on Tuesday, March 10 and students are required to leave by noon on Tuesday, March 17.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Students and parents are also concerned about the financial impacts of the online shift. While some schools with large endowments, including Harvard, Brown, and Princeton, have announced that they will refund prorated room and board costs to students forced to return home, not all schools have announced plans. Because of the high cost of issuing refunds, some schools may not be able to afford them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For students and faculty at schools that are suddenly moving classes online, the future seems foggy as students question how the change will work and instructors try to make the switch as smooth as possible.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Colette Feehan, a doctoral student who teaches a large linguistics class at Indiana University, is hopeful that she can maintain quality instruction but is concerned about the university\'92s ability to adapt.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 \'93
\f2\b0 I teach a discussion class, which does not lend itself particularly well to an online platform,\'94 she said. Her biggest concern is that she and other instructors won\'92t be able to see whether students are absorbing the material to adapt their lectures accordingly. \'93I can\'92t tell if people aren\'92t understanding if I\'92m not in the room with them,\'94 she said.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Other classes are even harder to transition. \'93Moving an in-person ceramics class into an online format requires a complete course re-design,\'94 said Priya Thoresen, who teaches studio art at the University of Minnesota. \'93I\'92m trying to be optimistic and think of it as a chance to teach a ceramics history course,\'94 she said, \'93but putting together materials and setting up what\'92s pretty much a new course from scratch is a lot of extra work.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Some schools that have already made the switch have experienced challenges. The transition \'93hasn\'92t been amazing,\'94 said Violet Sinnarkar, a senior studying 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at the University of California, Berkeley.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Since this is her final semester in college, she decided to take a lot of \'93bucket list\'94 classes in subjects about which she really wanted to learn. For most of them, the transition online has been choppy at best. \'93I\'92m taking a language class because I really wanted to pick up Hindi,\'94 she said. \'93But we had our first class over Zoom today and it was basically impossible to have those small, casual group conversations that really help you master a language.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s funny because I think a lot of students were hoping classes got canceled until it actually happened,\'94 Sinnarkar said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s funny because I think a lot of students were hoping classes got canceled until it actually happened,\'94 Sinnarkar said. \'93But after a class or two on Zoom you realize it\'92s much worse. You don\'92t see your friends anymore, you\'92re not sure when the midterm is anymore, it\'92s much harder to stay focused and motivated.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 She is worried that Berkeley will follow other schools that have made final decisions to keep students learning online for the rest of the semester.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While online instruction may not be ideal, experts suggest that students and faculty may just have to make the most of it for the near future. Gregory Gray, professor of medicine, global health, and environmental health at Duke University, said that transitioning to online instruction shows that leaders take coronavirus seriously. He also noted that the risk of the virus may not dissipate soon. \'93I do not see an end to high SARS-CoV2 transmission for at least six months,\'94 Gray said. \'93There are just too many susceptible people.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Schools with strong online infrastructures, such as MIT, are much more prepared for the shift
\f1\b .
\f2\b0  At Indiana, though, Feehan is worried about instructors who \'93only have the technology required to do a Zoom meeting on their campus computers. It\'92s not clear if they will have to run those video lectures from home,\'94 she said. While Indiana University and other schools that have moved classes online are doing their best to offer around-the-clock support as instructors prepare online classes, glitches seem inevitable.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Transitioning can also be an issue for students, especially those who lack internet access at home and will no longer have easy-to-reach tech support once they leave campus. Recognizing the limits of internet access, Berea College in Kentucky canceled its classes for the remainder of the semester.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since the cancellations began, instructors across the country have gathered online to share tips about how to take classes online. Some professors can already speak from experience: Tim Bonebrake, an associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Hong Kong, has been teaching online classes since early February.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s an odd feeling lecturing to a camera,\'94 Bonebrake wrote for Small Pond Science. \'93It\'92s also odd answering questions verbally that are posed through the chat.\'94 But he remains optimistic about his ability to help his students learn, even though two of his classes have large laboratory components.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93If all involved are willing to engage, then I believe course content can be effectively conveyed,\'94 he said in a Martin Center interview.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Of course, maintaining that level of involvement takes a lot of effort. \'93It\'92s harder to connect to students in online classes,\'94 he said. \'93It\'92s the personal connection that I think is harder to establish during video conferencing. I miss it and I suspect my students do too.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Among the developed nations, fertility rates have been declining since the first quarter of the 19th century, even if the trend has not been linear. This factor, combined with increases in life expectancy, has created one of the greatest challenges to society today. As the working-age population shrinks, the ranks of the aged swell.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The 2019 United Nations population survey predicts that the world population will rise from 7.7 billion today to 11.2 billion by 2100. That growth will be driven mainly by the nations of Africa, whose population is expected to expand from 1.34 billion to 4.28 billion by the end of the century. By contrast, 55 countries will see their populations decline, including 26 where the number will decline by more than 10 percent. UN statisticians predict that, globally, the fertility ratio will decline from 2.5 to 2.2, while longevity will rise from 72.6 years to 77.1 years by midcentury.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Two hundred years is a relatively short sample period, but it is probably safe to predict that rich, successful societies, especially ones where women are well-educated and have reproductive freedom, choose fertility rates that imply gradual population decline.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As any financial advisor will tell you, as we age, our economic needs change too. Upon joining the labor force, we plan to start our own families. Some of us save; others continue to spend their newly minted wealth, only to discover that saving would have been prudent. The rearing of children is an expensive pastime.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Once our children have grown and flown, we switch our economic focus to the task of saving enough to retire. If we are healthy, this is easier than if we must pay for medical care, but most of us are confronted by similar lifestyle considerations. When we finally retire, as the economist Franco Modigliani discovered as long ago as 1954, we continue to spend, but, unlike our younger selves, we consume far less conspicuously.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the national level, this aging process can be seen everywhere, not least in the level of inflation and interest rates. In this scenario, central bank policies, aimed at stimulating consumption by artificially lowering interest rates, are akin to King Canute\'92s attempt to turn back the tide. An aging nation will consume less. The retired must live on their savings; if the rate of interest on those savings falls, they will be forced to consume less. For many, the calculations they made about the capital needed for retirement have proved inadequate. As a wise man once said, \'93It\'92s not that I saved too little; it\'92s simply that I never expected to live this long.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For the governments of aging countries, charged with the provision of benefits for the retired, the problems are severe. They too have miscalculated. State pensions are predominantly paid out of current taxation; the system is unfunded. The robbing of Peter to pay Paul only works if the ratio between those who work and pay taxes and those who do not is sufficient to meet the needs of the latter.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nowhere are these trends more evident than in Japan. It is a country in the vanguard of demographic decline. Its response to the indefatigable march of time has been tentative, but there is hope, as always, in human ingenuity. Our ability to automate tasks once performed by humans, across agriculture, industry, services, and other sectors, enables us to do more with less.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Taken to its logical conclusion, if automation is successful, it obviates the need for a growing workforce to meet the welfare needs of its aging population. Since man first picked up a stick to plow a furrow, we have been on a path to improve productivity by means of innovation: this trend is far from new.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Much has been written about the fate of workers, as artificial intelligence (AI) usurps the role of humans in innumerable professions. A 2013 study by Oxford University caused consternation, suggesting that, in the coming decades, 47 percent of total U.S. employment was at risk of automation. In a global study, the International Labour Organization warned that this was not just a developed-country problem. It predicts that 56 percent of the workforce of Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam is at risk of technological substitution within 20 years. It transpires that Asian robot sales increased 19 percent in 2015; the process has already begun.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The table below indicates which U.S. jobs are most at risk, but a similar picture is evident in other developed and developing countries. The inflection point will be determined by average earning per capita.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 McKinsey Global Institute, which compiled this research, concludes that roughly 60 percent of occupations are at risk of 30 percent automation, just based on the development of existing technologies. There is a ray of hope, however: the authors note that the benefits of that same automation could boost global productivity growth by 0.8 to 1.4 percent annually.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If you are still inclined to view automation as a risk rather than an opportunity, then you may be more heartened by a 2016 OECD study of 21 of its member nations. The OECD\'92s researchers are less optimistic about the degree to which all the stages of a bundled set of tasks (which is typical of the majority of business processes) can be automated. It believes only 9 percent of jobs are truly at risk from automation.\'a0

\f2\fs20 The table below, taken from the January 2018 MIT Technology Review, highlights the difficulty with making predictions about the future of employment and the impact of technology.

\f2\fs20 The article concludes:\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In short, although these predictions are made by dozens of global experts in economics and technology, no one seems to be on the same page. There is really only one meaningful conclusion: we have no idea how many jobs will actually be lost to the march of technological progress.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Before you throw your hands up in despair, it is worth considering that, if automation is inevitable, a fertility rate of less than two could be a boon rather than a curse. In fact, for nations with higher fertility rates, including many on the African subcontinent, the challenge of automation is greater than for those with aging populations.

\f2\fs20 The Graying of Japan
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In a June 2018 publication, the IMF\'92s Finance and Development suggest that Japan\'92s combination of artificial intelligence and robotics may be the answer to its labor-shortage problem. Already a quarter of Japan\'92s population is over 65 and the number of people of working age (15 to 64 years) is projected to fall by 24 million by 2050.

\f2\fs20 Japan has been facing the demographic challenge of limited resources \'97 both of labor and of natural resources \'97 for many years. Here is how it ranks in robots per capita.
\f0\fs24 \

\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Japan remains the largest exporter of robots, although, since 2009, it has slipped down the world ranking by usage. The country\'92s most productive industrial sectors are automotive and electronics, yet 75 percent of Japanese GDP is still generated by services. It is here that AI will be deployed most effectively, engendering substantial productivity gains. These gains are long overdue; productivity in Japanese manufacturing has tripled since 1970, while in nonmanufacturing the gain has been a meager 25 percent.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The subsectors that should see dramatic gains include transportation, communications, health care, finance, retail services, and storage. The Japanese have even introduced robot chefs and hotel staff. The next phase will see robots replacing humans in schools, hospitals, nursing homes, airports, railway stations, and many other service industries, where simple, repetitive tasks can be more efficiently and cost-effectively performed by machines.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The migration to machines is not occurring without issues. As labor shortages become more severe, Japan has seen the quality of human services decline. Its labor force is bifurcating into a minority of workers with the training and education required to benefit from robotic productivity. Among the losers are female workers who have only recently joined the labor force and those who have taken on temporary roles.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The ultimate technological solution to the twin headwinds of an aging population and shrinking workforce will be better service at lower cost. These are the good deflationary forces of human progress. In the long run, Japanese consumers will end up paying less and getting more.\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For a more futuristic take on how automation is solving the problems of aging and labor shortages in Japan, this article from Towards 
\f4\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  (\'93Robots, Aging Population and Pets\'94) is instructive. Here is a taste:\'a0
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In a nursing home in Natori, Miyagi Prefecture, a Humanoid robot asks an elderly nursing resident in her 80s, \'93Grandma, what color flowers do you like?\'94. The woman responds, \'93Pink cherry blossoms\'94.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This humanoid is the first of its kind to be used in a Japanese retirement home. It is developed by Hiroshi Ishiguro and his team of engineers from Osaka University. Since the use of this humanoid, nursing home staffers report less irritation, improved cognitive functions and improved mental health conditions from residents in this nursing home.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A Sapporo-based company Safety Net linkage is developing smartphone applications in conjunction with this humanoid to help to track down people with dementia. These applications will allow families and nursing home facilities to keep an eye on elderly residents in cases of missing persons.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Easing the Adjustment
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Advances in technology have always created societal challenges. For developed-nation governments, labor-market reforms are key. A focus on supporting workers rather than creating jobs is at the heart of the philosophical change required. Improving the quality of technical and vocational education and training is critical. For more than a decade, internet-based video technology has been capable of delivering both short- and long-form education. In theory, the cost of training has been vastly reduced. As governments\'92 tax base shrinks, their budgets will decrease. They will need to adopt these productivity-enhancing technologies to deliver educational services at lower cost.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There will inevitably be calls for government subsidies and tax incentives to encourage corporate investment in training and skills, focused on areas where humans have a comparative advantage over machines. There are worse things to spend our taxes on. The cutting of red tape would be better. Greater flexibility in labor regulations will be needed to compensate for the relative increase in the cost of skilled workers. Corporations and their employees can both benefit from flexible contracts and continuous professional development.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Conclusion
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Declining fertility rates, increasing longevity, and technological progress are trends with strong momentum. If embraced rather than ignored \'97 or, worse still, impeded \'97 productivity can be boosted while the quality of life and of employment can be improved. Demographic decline is inevitable; if approached as an opportunity, it can be a blessing rather than a curse.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Since 2016, colleges and universities have fought to stay open as enrollments fall, especially liberal arts colleges. Many colleges are adding more certificate programs in technology fields and dropping low-enrollment humanities programs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The threat has been most acute for small liberal-arts colleges with small endowments that rely on tuition for most of their revenue.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 To stay open, colleges are lowering tuition and mergers are growing in popularity. Colleges must adapt to changes in the economy and technology that render a mediocre liberal arts education less valuable. Research from the Brookings Institution, however, claims that \'93Within this generation is a growing recognition that liberal arts grads\'97working alongside engineers\'97are a key ingredient to sustaining innovation.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Students who earn liberal arts degrees and can\'92t find a job might also need to consider a one- or two-year master\'92s program to develop specific skills in fields such as finance, accounting, or 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . Those programs are gaining popularity with liberal arts graduates who want to enter corporate America.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Students may also realize that their college education is mostly a signal, rather than an enriching and rewarding experience. Much to the chagrin of politicians on the left, colleges operate similarly to market institutions. If they fail to attract students and build sufficient endowments, they may merge or close.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The latest report of the Fraser Institute\'92s Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) has just been released and South Africa continues to lag behind the rest of the world.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This year (which uses the 2017 data) South Africa fell two places from 99 to 101 in the world on the EFW Index.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The immediate implication of this is that two more countries are economically freer than South Africa, following the nine countries that surpassed the country the year before.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 According to the index, South Africa experienced an improvement in four of the five areas of the EFW, which is why the index score improved from 6.58 to 6.61.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the legal system and property rights area, South Africa regressed from 5.19 to 5.05.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The biggest drop was in the protection of property rights, which is not a surprise given the governing ANC\'92s decision to adopt land expropriation without compensation as policy last year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Indices such as the EFW help in measuring policy reform progress.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Economic freedom is essential to economic prosperity: there\'92s no shortcut, no way to circumvent the laws of economics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 People are most productive when given the freedom to be productive. Indeed, this is what you see when you look around the world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The countries with the greatest degree of economic freedom are also the ones with the highest GDP per capita as well as the lowest levels of poverty.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The best argument that those who despise freedom can offer is to point to inequality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 All well and good, except that the countries with the highest levels of inequality tend to be the ones in the third quartile (25%) of the EFW.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 How can we explain this? Why are the freest countries not the most unequal if capitalism causes inequality? Conversely, why are the least free countries not the most unequal?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The short answer is: I don\'92t know, but I think it is possible to make reasonable, logical guesses as to what\'92s going on.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The freest countries are not the most unequal simply because free economies are the most dynamic and meritocratic, it is possible to make it from the bottom of the pile in society to the very top.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is why you see billionaires coming from all walks of life in these countries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Even a South African laaitjie such as Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, can become a billionaire in the US while in South Africa the only ones who become rich are those connected either to politicians or to someone who is already rich.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Countries in the fourth quartile are not the most unequal because by the time a country gets to that stage, the capital base (wealth) has been so destroyed that everyone is essentially poor, except, perhaps, for a few politically connected individuals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The third quartile is made up of the most unequal countries simply because they have the greatest government interventions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Without the state having direct control of the entire economy, private capital gets used to fund the cronyism and corruption enabled by the state intervention.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The EFW is a very useful tool. Our government should consider using it to measure progress towards reform.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other indices that complement the EFW should also be used.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not only are the most economically free countries the wealthiest, they also, contrary to popular belief, don\'92t contain the most unequal societies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is countries in the third quartile of the EFW, where South Africa sits, that tend to be the most unequal.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 CLEMSON \'97 An agreement between Clemson University and Erskine College will allow mathematics students at the Due West school to transfer to Clemson after three years and earn bachelor\'92s degrees from both schools in just two more years.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The program targets students interested in the actuarial science/financial mathematics emphasis area at Clemson, which is the most popular in the College of Science\'92s school of mathematical and statistical sciences, according to senior lecturer Mark Cawood.

\f2\fs20 Mathematics majors at Erskine would be able to transfer to Clemson after completing 93 hours of coursework. After one year in Clemson\'92s actuarial science/financial math program, they would receive a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from Erskine. In one more year, they can graduate with a Bachelor of Science in mathematical sciences from Clemson, completing courses not available at Erskine.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Holding two degrees would make graduates more attractive to employers who are already hiring Clemson actuarial science/financial math majors in the insurance, financial and 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  fields.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The idea for the program came from three Clemson alumni who are faculty members at Erskine: Kokou Yano Abalo, Young Professor and chair of the math department; Catherine White, assistant professor and Dual Degree Programs coordinator; and Art Gorka, professor. All three earned doctorates in Clemson\'92s mathematical sciences department.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The big thing about math majors is that they are able to think critically,\'94 said Cawood, who noted that the students also take two semesters of computer science courses due to the growth in the fields of data analytics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The transition to Clemson should be easier for Erskine students because three of their professors earned math degrees at Clemson.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93When they come here they\'92re going to have a solid foundation,\'94\'a0Cawood\'a0said. \'93We know the courses they\'92ve had.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93They can build confidence as they begin their collegiate career in a small, community-driven environment at Erskine and finish their education at Clemson where they will have access to a vast number of resources and experiences that are only available at a large, well-respected institution such as Clemson,\'94 White said. \'93I believe giving students such a diverse educational experience will make them more marketable as they enter the professional world.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The agreement was signed this spring by Erskine President Robert E. Gustafson and Clemson Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Robert Jones. Students in the program could begin moving to Clemson as soon as fall 2020.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 26th Annual TFAS Journalism Awards Dinner Extols Pursuit of Truth
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Truth, and the fervent need to fight for it, took center stage at this year\'92s 26th Annual TFAS Journalism Awards Dinner in New York City on Sept. 12, 2019. The Daily Signal covered the event where nearly 200 guests gathered to celebrate our 2019 Rago and Novak Fellows, honor the life of the late Joseph Rago and recognize the outstanding reporters who have paved the way for the next generation of journalists.

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Roger Kimball

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Achieving \'91the accurate representation of the world\'92 is not only a linguistic desideratum, it is also a political imperative. Much of our culture has colluded against the accurate representation of the world. We owe The Fund for American Studies a great debt for understanding what is at stake in the seemingly pedestrian activity of telling the truth. Long may it prosper,\'94 he said. Kimball\'92s full remarks were published in SpectatorUSA, and as a podcast via The New Criterion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The evening introduced Matthew Taylor King as our 2019 recipient of the Joseph Rago Fellowship for Excellence in Journalism, named in honor of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer. Joe\'92s father Paul and his former editor Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal gave stirring remarks reflecting on the tremendous accomplishments of Joe\'92s career and his lasting legacy.

\f2\fs20 \'93You are here tonight not only to honor individuals, but also to uphold ideals. Both the Novak and Rago Fellowships are dedicated not to commemorate what they died of, but to celebrate what they lived for \'96 the pursuit of truth, in all its complexity and nuance,\'94 said Paul Rago. \'93We remember [Joe\'92s] contributions and celebrate the ideals he embraced to understand the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The dinner also showcased our 2019 Robert Novak Journalism Fellowship Award recipients, who took to the stage to thank attendees for their support and provided brief remarks on the writing projects their Fellowships will make possible. The Fellowships are named for Robert D. Novak, renowned reporter, syndicated columnist and co-host of CNN\'92s \'93Crossfire.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Photojournalism, religion, 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , politics and philosophy may seem like an unusual combination, but 22 participants from 14 countries came together and explored these subjects to learn the value of the free press in a free society at the 2019 European Journalism Institute (EJI)\'a0in Prague this summer.

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Joanna Jasin?ska \'9219
\f2\b0 , a journalist with the Polish Press Agency who moved into the journalism field after working in diplomacy for six years, said the program taught her why there is a growing need for proper, fact-based journalism.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93This program gave me faith in the future of media and journalism,\'94 Jasin?ska said. \'93There are many trends happening right now that could fill you with pessimism about journalism, but this gave me a renewed understanding that there is real, important meaning behind what we are doing.\'94

\f1\b The Fund for American Studies (TFAS)
\f2\b0 \'a0and our program partner\'a0
\f1\b The Media Project (TMP)
\f2\b0  introduced new ideas to student and working journalists from around the world. Through interactive lessons and discussion sessions, faculty brought forth important ideas surrounding journalistic integrity, threats in spreading disinformation, conflict and religion reporting, media bias and ethics.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 At the closing ceremony, TFAS and TMP presented David Blevins from Sky News in North Ireland with the 2019 EJI Freedom of the Press Award for his accuracy and integrity in reporting as a safeguard to democracy. You can read more about the program at TFAS.org/EJI19.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Generous TFAS supporters 
\f1\b Fred and Georganna Long
\f2\b0  are being recognized for their impactful $3 million bequest to TFAS. The Pasadena Voice published a piece last week on how their gift will leave a lasting legacy by providing scholarships for students to attend TFAS programs in both the U.S. and abroad.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fred believed strongly in the free enterprise system and the power to not only build wealth but to also educate future generations.\'94

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Longs\'92 $3 million donation marks the second-largest monetary donation in the 52-year history of The Fund for American Studies, and the largest scholarship donation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Longtime TFAS supporters Fred and Georganna Long are pictured above during a visit to Antarctica in 2000. Their generous bequest to TFAS leaves a lasting legacy of scholarships for deserving students.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The article details how the Longs were inspired to support TFAS by John Engalitcheff Jr., Fred\'92s mentor at Baltimore Aircoil Company (BAC). Engalitcheff was the founder of BAC and left a transformative $12 million gift to the organization in 1990. After learning about TFAS, Fred and Georganna set up two scholarship programs \'96 one in 2000 to provide scholarship to deserving students to attend TFAS programs in Washington, D.C., and another in 2007 that enables cadets from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy to attend our TFAS International Programs in Chile, Hong Kong and Prague.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fred passed away in August of 2013, and Georganna passed in February of 2018.\'a0Hundreds of students will be able to take part in TFAS programs for years to come, thanks to the great generosity and vision of the Long family and their dedication to investing in educating future generations about the importance of liberty and free enterprise.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 O cen\'e1rio \'e9 dos piores. Por volta de 2050, oito em cada dez habitantes do planeta Terra viver\'e3o em cidades. At\'e9 l\'e1, indica a ONU, a popula\'e7\'e3o mundial deve aumentar em cerca de 3 bilh\'f5es de pessoas, chegando ao redor dos 10 bilh\'f5es. Para alimentar toda essa gente, mantidas as pr\'e1ticas agr\'edcolas atuais, ser\'e1 necess\'e1rio 1 bilh\'e3o de hectares de terra nova, o equivalente a 20% do territ\'f3rio brasileiro. Hoje em dia, 80% do solo adequado \'e0 agricultura est\'e1 comprometido. Detalhe: 15% dele est\'e1 estragado, devastado pelo uso inadequado.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 T\'e3o claro quanto \'f3bvio \'97 do jeito que est\'e1, imposs\'edvel continuar. Em pouco tempo n\'e3o haver\'e1 terra ar\'e1vel para alimentar todo mundo. \'93E o que pode ser feito para impedir esse desastre?\'94, provoca Dickson Despommier, 79 anos, professor em\'e9rito de microbiologia e sa\'fade p\'fablica da Universidade Columbia, nos Estados Unidos.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 H\'e1 esperan\'e7a. E ela est\'e1\'85 nas cidades. Sim, o futuro da alimenta\'e7\'e3o tamb\'e9m est\'e1 sendo cultivado dentro de edif\'edcios, cont\'eaineres e galp\'f5es mundo afora. Em tempos de escassez de terreno f\'e9rtil e limita\'e7\'f5es clim\'e1ticas, parte da solu\'e7\'e3o para o esgotamento do campo, a fome e a busca por um mundo mais sustent\'e1vel passa necessariamente pelas fazendas urbanas; em especial as verticais \'97 cujo conceito foi desenvolvido, no final dos anos 90, por Dickson. \'93O plantio vertical pode ser alocado em qualquer lugar do mundo e permite o cultivo das plantas comest\'edveis mais consumidas, essenciais para uma dieta equilibrada\'94, defendeu o professor de Columbia, em conversa com \'c9poca NEG\'d3CIOS.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Gra\'e7as ao aperfei\'e7oamento de ferramentas como sensores de internet das coisas, ci\'eancia de dados, intelig\'eancia artificial e big data, o cultivo vertical permite ganhos ao longo de toda a cadeia produtiva \'97 do momento da planta\'e7\'e3o das sementes \'e0 chegada do alimento no prato do consumidor. At\'e9 2025, o setor de agricultura vertical, apenas ele, deve movimentar US$ 9,6 bilh\'f5es, crescendo a uma taxa composta anual (CAGR) de 21,3%, segundo relat\'f3rio de abril de 2019, da empresa de consultoria americana Grand View Research. As novas tecnologias est\'e3o na base desse movimento. Os olhos dos investidores brilham.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Em julho do ano passado, no maior aporte j\'e1 feito at\'e9 ent\'e3o para uma agtech, o grupo japon\'eas SoftBank investiu US$ 200 milh\'f5es na Plenty. Fundada em 2014 em S\'e3o Francisco por Matt Barnard (atual CEO), Nate Storey, Jack Oslan e Nate Mazonson, a startup cultiva hortali\'e7as e frutas em torres de seis metros de altura. \'c9 bel\'edssimo \'97 as plantas se projetando para fora, formando paredes enormes de mostarda, kale, alface, tomate\'85 Na fazenda Tigris, as verduras e frutas crescem em um substrato produzido a partir de garrafas pl\'e1sticas recicladas. Por enquanto, a produ\'e7\'e3o est\'e1 restrita \'e0 ba\'eda de S\'e3o Francisco, mas a empresa pretende construir uma fazenda com cerca de 9,3 mil metros quadrados, na cidade de Kent, pr\'f3xima a Seattle, no estado de Washington. Os planos de expans\'e3o tamb\'e9m incluem China e Jap\'e3o.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mais um exemplo da efervesc\'eancia do setor? Em dezembro de 2018, menos de dois anos depois de seu lan\'e7amento, a agtech Bowery, de Nova York, levantou US$ 95 milh\'f5es em uma rodada de investimentos liderada pelo Google Ventures. Alguns meses antes, Irving Fain, CEO e cofundador da startup, convidou Brian Donato para deixar o cargo de diretor de opera\'e7\'f5es da Amazon e assumir o posto de vice-presidente s\'eanior de opera\'e7\'f5es da fazenda nova-iorquina. O executivo aceitou.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 O entusiasmo em torno da agricultura vertical \'e9 compreens\'edvel. As fazendas indoor se provaram at\'e9 agora mais rent\'e1veis do que as horizontais, em campo aberto. A come\'e7ar por economia de espa\'e7o e ganho de produtividade. Em 2017, tr\'eas jovens engenheiros fundaram a Pink Farms, na capital paulista. A primeira e maior fazenda urbana vertical da Am\'e9rica Latina est\'e1 instalada em um galp\'e3o ao lado da agitad\'edssima Marginal Tiet\'ea. A produ\'e7\'e3o comercial come\'e7ou em junho passado e, por enquanto, as planta\'e7\'f5es est\'e3o alojadas em uma torre de oito andares, cuja base mede 18,5 metros quadrados. \'93No campo, isso equivaleria a 1.850 metros quadrados\'94, diz Geraldo Maia, 28 anos, s\'f3cio-fundador da Pink Farms. \'93Por metro quadrado de ch\'e3o, n\'f3s somos cem vezes mais produtivos.\'94 Na agricultura vertical, o fazendeiro tem dom\'ednio total sobre o ambiente. Luz, temperatura, umidade, irriga\'e7\'e3o\'85 Toucas, m\'e1scaras, luvas e protetores de sapato\'85 Entrar na \'e1rea de cultivo da fazenda paulistana requer uma assepsia t\'e3o (ou mais) rigorosa quanto a exigida nas UTIs dos melhores hospitais.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Como as planta\'e7\'f5es est\'e3o protegidas das intemp\'e9ries e do ataque de pragas, os alimentos cultivados indoor dispensam o uso de agrot\'f3xicos. Org\'e2nicos, suspiram os consumidores modernos, mais bem informados e engajados. Nas fazendas urbanas, os neg\'f3cios n\'e3o se guiam mais pelo ritmo das esta\'e7\'f5es. L\'e2mpadas LED fazem as vezes de sol. O agricultor 4.0 consegue ajustar o comprimento de onda mais adequado a cada esp\'e9cie. Dia e noite. Claro e escuro. Rosa e azul\'85 \'c9 a fotoss\'edntese hightech na produ\'e7\'e3o de alimentos, com uma concentra\'e7\'e3o maior de vitaminas e minerais em compara\'e7\'e3o aos produtos cultivados ao ar livre. Como costuma dizer Nick Kalayjian, vice-presidente s\'eanior de engenharia da Plenty, \'93damos \'e0s plantas o ambiente perfeito para que elas sejam as melhores e mais desej\'e1veis vers\'f5es de si mesmas\'94. O prato ganha alimentos mais saborosos e nutritivos.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Na prov\'edncia de Miyagi, no leste do Jap\'e3o, os p\'e9s de alface crescem em um ritmo at\'e9 40 vezes maior do que nos campos tradicionais. Gra\'e7as a uma parceria com o bi\'f3logo Shigeharu Shimamura, as 17,5 mil l\'e2mpadas LED usadas na planta\'e7\'e3o foram fabricadas pela GE com ondas no comprimento exato para agilizar o crescimento das plantas. A planta\'e7\'e3o hightech de Miyagi foi erguida em uma f\'e1brica de semicondutores da Sony, abandonada depois do tsunami de 2011. Em 2.322 metros quadrados s\'e3o produzidas 10 mil cabe\'e7as de alface, todos os dias.

\f2\fs20 \'c9 curioso imaginar uma lavoura sem terra, mas, ao se visitar uma fazenda vertical, volta-se de l\'e1 com os sapatos e a barra das cal\'e7as t\'e3o limpos quanto no momento da chegada \'97 qui\'e7\'e1 at\'e9 mais higienizados. Na agricultura vertical, o cultivo \'e9 feito por hidroponia. Por essa t\'e9cnica, a nutri\'e7\'e3o das plantas vem de uma mistura de \'e1gua e sais essenciais. De novo, as novas tecnologias conseguem determinar com precis\'e3o as quantidades necess\'e1rias de cada um desses ingredientes. Um coquetel espec\'edfico para a alface, outro para o agri\'e3o, um terceiro para a r\'facula\'85 \'93Com isso, h\'e1 uma economia de 50% no uso de fertilizantes\'94, diz Geraldo, da Pink Farms. No campo, esses compostos s\'e3o despejados no solo. Cabe \'e0 raiz da planta capt\'e1-los. Para que cumpram seu papel a contento, \'e9 necess\'e1ria uma quantidade bem maior do que se fossem despejados diretamente na raiz. Pelo mesmo motivo, como dispensam o uso da terra, nas fazendas verticais, o gasto de \'e1gua representa apenas de 5% a 1% do consumo nas planta\'e7\'f5es convencionais.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Como est\'e3o nas cidades, as fazendas verticais ficam mais pr\'f3ximas dos consumidores e os custos com log\'edstica e transporte diminuem \'97 e a emiss\'e3o de poluentes tamb\'e9m. Mas n\'e3o s\'f3 isso. Ao queimar etapas, a taxa de desperd\'edcio dos produtos reduz sobremaneira. Segundo Geraldo, da Pink Farms, no modelo tradicional de agricultura, 40% da produ\'e7\'e3o de folhosas estraga no caminho entre o campo e os pontos de distribui\'e7\'e3o e venda, sobretudo por mau acondicionamento e/ou falta de embalagem adequada. Com os alimentos vindos das fazendas verticais, o consumidor ganha ao levar para casa alimentos frescos \'97 independentemente do lugar e da \'e9poca do ano.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Na configura\'e7\'e3o do agroneg\'f3cio 4.0, as fazendas verticais t\'eam um papel importante, mas est\'e3o longe de ser a panaceia para todos os males do campo. Com a tecnologia dispon\'edvel hoje em dia, por exemplo, as culturas est\'e3o restritas \'e0s hortali\'e7as e alguns legumes e frutas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Teoricamente, tudo o que cresce na terra poderia ser cultivado em uma fazenda vertical. Mas do ponto de vista financeiro, atualmente, n\'e3o vale a pena erguer uma planta\'e7\'e3o de mangas em ambiente fechado. Ou de gr\'e3os. \'93As tecnologias para plantar alimento indoor acabaram de ser inventadas\'94, diz o professor Dickson, de Columbia. Segundo os entusiastas do modelo de cultivo vertical, \'e9 s\'f3 uma quest\'e3o de tempo. Pode ser. Cinco anos atr\'e1s, dizem os especialistas, as fazendas verticais do modo como as conhecemos hoje seriam impens\'e1veis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Em compara\'e7\'e3o \'e0s fazendas em campo aberto, a produtividade das verticais, metro quadrado por metro quadrado de ch\'e3o, \'e9 indubitavelmente maior, mas ainda assim elas demandam espa\'e7o. Segundo o professor Dickson, para alimentar 50 mil pessoas, a fazenda deveria ter uma altura equivalente a 30 andares e uma base do tamanho de meio quarteir\'e3o. Para a cidade de S\'e3o Paulo, seriam necess\'e1rios 244 edif\'edcios. Para Manhattan, 33. E Pequim, 430.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Por enquanto, para o consumidor, os produtos vindos das fazendas indoor s\'e3o de 10% a 15% mais caros do que seus equivalentes cultivados em campo aberto. Em rela\'e7\'e3o aos org\'e2nicos, por\'e9m, tendem a ser de 15% a 20% mais baratos. \'93O custo pode ser um limite hoje\'94, concorda Dickson. \'93Mas, em breve, chegar\'e1 a hora em que eles ser\'e3o subsidiados pelos governos, de modo a garantir alimentos saud\'e1veis e sustent\'e1veis para todos os cidad\'e3os, em todos os pa\'edses.\'94 H\'e1 esperan\'e7a.

No inverno, quando as temperaturas podem chegar a -30\'baC durante os quatro meses de escurid\'e3o, ele cultiva microgreens, vegetais em estado jovem, com alto teor de nutrientes e sabor intenso.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There\'92s nothing about South Africa that makes it impossible to start a successful business here. Nothing that is, except the government.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is a lesser problem if you already have access to money and can thus afford things like lawyers and accountants, it is a much bigger problem for the enterprising young person living in a township. Some regulations are quite absurd. For example, if you want to start growing and selling medical marijuana (a business that many poor people in townships are already involved in, albeit illegally), you have to comply with the conditions of a licence that could cost you R44,000\'a0or more.\'a0This is according to regulations issued by the Minister of Health in April 2019.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nowhere in the economy is the difference between the haves and have nots as stark as in the economic sectors where the government applies the most stringent regulations. Ultimately, regulation causes the very thing that governments claim to hate: concentration of industry. The rich can afford to comply while the poor cannot, it is as simple as that.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is especially true of the financial industry. In recent years South Africans have been hearing calls from our latter-day socialists for the establishment of a state bank to service poor black people, but we already have proto-financial institutions in the form of the so-called mashonisas (loan sharks). The problem? South Africa\'92s elites confuse their own wants and needs with those of everyone else, especially the poor.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This means that mashonisas are not recognised for the vital role they play in the lives of many poor people because their financial and credit needs are not the same as that of policy-makers. I still remember when I got my first job in 2012, I had to attend training for the first month without pay. Mashonisas filled the gap at least for the first three months, I used the loans to pay for transport and other costs.

\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Now, mashonisas currently provide pay-day finance to people who do not qualify for loans anywhere else because of their risk profile, these businesses can be found in virtually any workplace in South Africa. Every workplace I have ever been a part of has had a resident mashonisa, even though most of these were illegal. It just goes to show that government cannot abolish a business for which demand exists, it can only drive it underground and make it riskier, including forcing market participants to engage in violence in resolving their disputes because they cannot take each other to court.

\cf0 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It turns out that the requirements for a banking licence in South Africa are explicitly anti-poor and anti-small business. For a mutual bank (bank in which depositors own the bank, (comparable to a stokvel), prospective entrepreneurs will require at least R10 million in capital. This is in addition to regulations on interest by the National Credit Act (which means if your customers\'92 profile is inherently risky you cannot adjust interest rates to account for this).

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Reserve Bank, as the prudential authority, can also add further requirements based on their judgement of what is in the public interest. In reality, the public interest is in the eye of the beholder. I would say if a bank can attract depositors and borrowers, then, clearly, its operations are in the public interest.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 You might think the conditions for starting a mutual bank are bad, considering the capital requirements for a commercial bank. If you are considering registering your own banking start-up you will need a cool R250 million in capital. It is also forbidden for any single person or entity to own more than 15% of the bank, meaning an essential tool for raising venture capital is \'a0less available (exchanging equity for operating capital).

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Clearly, setting up a bank is outside the reach of any enterprising poor young person who could start out taking small deposits (in the order of R100) and giving out small loans. This is despite the fact that mashonisas in townships and most workplaces in South Africa are already engaged in small-scale lending, illegally according to the current regulations. Considering the fact that banking in Europe began with small-scale money-changers and lenders that eventually grew into giant businesses, the current regulatory regime is simply not appropriate for a poor country like South Africa.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Politicians through regulation have created exactly the problem that they now propose to solve through further regulation and the creation of a state bank. South Africa is not lacking in poor black people who can start small businesses in the banking sector. It is the high start-up costs imposed by the government that make this virtually impossible. There\'92s no denying that a consequence of deregulating this sector would also entail an increase in the number of banks that fail. That would be fine, as long as customers have choice and access to banks that offer more or less security.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The market allows each individual to define their own risk appetite. Government regulation does not actually do away with this, it just makes it a privilege of the rich. The assumption underlying all regulation is that the poor cannot be trusted with risk while the rich can (remember, the higher the risk, the greater the reward). The cost of compliance invariably comes down to money: whether paying for consultants, paying for someone to spend time on your behalf filling in forms, capital requirements, licence fees etc.

\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The South African government simply cannot claim to be pro-poor while the poor are confronted with so much regulation when they dare start their own businesses, even businesses that they are already running through the black market. A pro-poor government would go on a massive drive to deregulate each and every sector of the economy, this would, of course, require ignoring the naysayers in their ivory towers who don\'92t know what it is like to go to bed on an empty stomach. Everyone who understands what it means to be poor will understand why it is a moral imperative of the highest order to deregulate the economy.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Poverty will not decline until poor people are allowed to make their own choices. This is true whether we are talking about communal land, employment contracts or regulations on banking and other industries. Having choices also means the possibility of failure. If we cannot accept that poor adults are not children, poverty is going to be with us for a while yet.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 TAMPA - The USF Jabil Innovation Institute unveiled Thursday started out two years ago as an idea sketched on a napkin at a bar on Redington Beach.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Pushing that napkin between them were two CEOs who also happened to be related by marriage: Mark Mondello of Jabil and Joel Momberg of the University of South Florida Foundation. (Their wives are sisters.)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "We're sitting around and he talks about, 'How do we take a really large local company that's influential in the community and mate it up with the local university?'" Mondello said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The answer is the Innovation Institute, which will enlist USF faculty and students in the pursuit of research that aligns with Jabil's global manufacturing services business.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Jabil will contribute $1 million - $800,000 as a gift and $200,000 in research support - in the first year as university administrators and company executives work out details for the new institute's work agenda, staffing and resources.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "I think it will sort itself out pretty quick," said Mondello, who earned a USF bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1987.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 USF president Steven C. Currall said: "We're trying to create the conditions in which innovation can happen in partnership with Jabil."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Initially, Mondello said, areas of research focus could include 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , information technology, 5G wireless infrastructure, cyber security, connected devices and engineering challenges related to digital health care - each of which is part of Jabil's bulging business portfolio.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "What this (creates) is an amazing platform for the wonderful students at USF to get their feet under them and work on real projects," Mondello said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Jabil has annual revenues of $25.3 billion and more than 200,000 employees. They work in about 100 facilities in nearly three dozen countries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With a total of 52 million square feet of manufacturing space, Jabil churns out a wide range of electronics, but also other products, from health care devices to network data equipment to packaging. The company's largest customers include Amazon, Apple, Cisco Systems, GoPro, Hewlett-Packard, LM Ericsson Telephone and Nokia Networks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Jabil will lease space at the Tampa Bay Technology Incubator in USF's Research Park, where university students and faculty will collaborate with Jabil teams.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "It allows access for our students to all sorts of great innovation" and provides "amazing educational opportunities," said USF senior vice president for research and innovation Paul Sanberg. "It allows our faculty to be involved in developing, with them and in partnerships, new products and all sorts of things."

\f2\fs20 \cf0 During this fast-paced, one-week summer program, 
\f1\b The Fund for American Studies (TFAS)
\f2\b0  and our program partner 
\f1\b The Media Project (TMP)
\f2\b0  introduced new ideas to student and working journalists from around the world. Through interactive lessons and discussion sessions, faculty brought forth important ideas surrounding journalistic integrity, threats in spreading disinformation, conflict and religion reporting, media bias and ethics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This year\'92s returning EJI faculty were TFAS alumnus\'a0Paul Glader \'9299, \'9200, journalism professor at The King\'92s College and executive director of The Media Project;

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93I enjoyed the philosophical and psychological side of Spieker\'92s discussion,\'94 Melanini said. \'93He structured \'91what a good journalist should do\'92 from the bottom up \'96 starting with energy and heart.

\f2\fs20 Melanini said the EJI program also provided her with a unique way to continue her studies over the summer and connected her with a global network of peers working in journalism.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93For me, the program was a really important way to make connections and gain new knowledge and new tools,\'94 she said. \'93It was valuable to see how journalism works in other countries.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Echoing Melanini\'92s sentiment, Jasin?ska shared that it was also curiosity \'96 a common characteristic of all journalists \'96 that brought the participants even closer.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We are all curious about the world and about other people,\'94 Jasin?ska said. \'93For me, it didn\'92t matter if someone was from Ukraine, the U.S., Palestine or Kosovo, they came from different places but they always have new perspectives and new experiences. We shared our countries and cultures to learn from each other, but more often than we realized, we learned we have so many things in common.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 EJI participants say farewell at the closing ceremony meal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This shared cultural experience was beneficial both inside and outside of the classroom because it allowed her to grow and learn from peers from other parts of the world.

\f2\fs20 \'93When you want to learn, you cannot learn only from your own country and its perspective because you will not get the whole story,\'94 she said. \'93We need to speak to people who are different \'96 it\'92s a crucial aspect of learning about yourself and about the world.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As the program concluded, TFAS and TMP presented 
\f1\b David Blevins
\f2\b0  from Sky News in North Ireland with the 
\f1\b 2019 EJI Freedom of the Press Award
\f2\b0  for his accuracy and integrity in reporting as a safeguard to democracy.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Blevins dedicated the award to the late Lyra McKee, a journalist from Northern Ireland who was fatally shot this year while reporting on riots in the Creggan area of Derry, Northern Ireland. Blevins, who notably covered much of the Irish peace process himself, spoke to the class about the media\'92s crucial role in times of distress.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Participant 
\f1\b Viktorya Muradyan \'9219
\f2\b0  of Armenia shared that she could identify with Mr. Blevins lecture because she understood the impacts of growing up in a conflict zone.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93His lecture gave me a desire to fill myself and others with hope,\'94 she said. \'93The only way I can do it is through my writing, through journalism.\'94

\f2\fs20 Following a week of exploring these vital issues in journalism, Jasin?ska said she walked away with a gratitude for a deeper understanding of truth and accuracy in reporting.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We live in a very complicated world in very complicated times, so people who can explain this world are very important,\'94 she said. \'93It makes sense to invest in young journalists so we can learn how to present some truth about everything going on around us.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Government intervention in the economy simply does not work. It is a mystery, then, why so many otherwise intelligent people keep calling for more of the same. After years of low growth (12 years now) concurrent with government fiscal deficits and various stimulus packages, we are now faced with retrenchments across the economy. The latest of which is Massmart announcing that it is considering retrenching 1,400 people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is not all, unfortunately. After that news from Massmart, Telkom announced it had informed trade unions that it will be cutting 20 percent of its 15,000 strong workforces (3,000 employees). These are only the latest blows for South Africa\'92s economy, especially the workers, as various organizations, ranging from Edcon to SAA, have also made similar announcements.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Despite the concurrence of all this bad news with an already high level of government intervention and further proposals for even greater intervention through EWC (Expropriation Without Compensation), NHI (National Health Insurance), etc. the\'a0Chairperson of Parliament\'92s Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic Development, Tourism Employment and Labour, Mandla Rayi, is proposing even greater government intervention in order to stop the job losses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the interest of all South Africans, it is time the government started listening to the rational voices in society. The policies of onerous regulation, bailouts, and loose fiscal policy have led us to where we are.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It seems clear that the political leaders of this country have yet to learn the lesson that while government intervention may feel good in the short-term, eventually someone always has to pay the piper. If the legislature tries to legislate away retrenchments, companies that need to cut costs to survive will simply go out of business. And more workers will become jobless.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The only other option, if we are talking about greater government involvement in the economy, is yet another bailout. This is after bailouts to SOEs amounting to hundreds of billions with last year\'92s R59 billion bailout to Eskom on top of the R23 billion per year already budgeted. The PIC (Public Investment Corporation) and the UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund), both state entities, were responsible for supplying the lion\'92s share of a previous R2.7 billion bailout to EDCON, a private company.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If another bailout is on the cards, it will only make South Africa\'92s lamentable fiscal situation worse. The country\'92s debt-to-GDP rocketed to more than 60 percent sooner than Treasury provided for in the 2019 February budget, the increase from 56 percent to 60 percent mainly caused by the bailout to Eskom. As we speak, the government is desperately trying to find the necessary funds to keep its commitment of a further R2 billion capitalization of SAA as part of the business rescue process.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If politicians truly understood the magnitude of the fiscal crisis facing the country, there would be no proposals for additional spending but rather how to cut government expenditure. The risks to the present and the future are great. Economist Mike Schussler wrote recently in Moneyweb about how the bond yield premium on South African long-term bonds relative to our emerging market peers has increased from 1.6 percent to 3.7 percent since the end of President Thabo Mbeki\'92s term of office.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There should also be significant cuts in government spending as well as reductions in taxes, especially payroll and corporate income taxes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Remember, interest on government debt can only be funded through revenue and not debt. This means bond yields are increasing in an environment where tax revenue, as a percentage of GDP, has been stagnant at 26 percent since 2008. The wider the fiscal deficit, the more revenue the state needs to raise through taxes. Given the aforementioned (increasing bond yields and stagnant tax revenue growth), this is simply not possible, bringing forward the possibility of a technical default, where the government cannot service its debt.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There are some actions the government could take to help the economy recover, but they are not quick and easy. These include deregulating the economy, especially the labor market. There should also be significant cuts in government spending as well as reductions in taxes, especially payroll and corporate income taxes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This would also mean letting companies that are in trouble fail. Every job saved via a government bailout diverts capital from productive investment in another area of the economy. This misallocation of resources eventually adds up and results in even bigger net job losses in the future. Given the raft of retrenchment stories making the news, we are now paying for years of loose fiscal policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the interest of all South Africans, it is time the government started listening to the rational voices in society. The policies of onerous regulation, bailouts, and loose fiscal policy have led us to where we are. Albert Einstein is rumored to have said, \'93The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\'94. Let us hope that sanity returns for the sake of the future of every South African child.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Government intervention in the economy simply does not work. It is a mystery, then, why so many otherwise intelligent people keep calling for more of the same. After years of low growth (12 years now) concurrent with government fiscal deficits and various stimulus packages, we are now faced with retrenchments across the economy. The latest of which is Massmart announcing that it is considering retrenching 1,400 people.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 That is not all, unfortunately. After that news from Massmart, Telkom announced it had informed trade unions that it will be cutting 20% of its 15,000 strong workforce (3,000 employees). These are only the latest blows for South Africa\'92s economy, especially the workers, as various organisations, ranging from Edcon to SAA, have also made similar announcements.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Despite the concurrence of all this bad news with an already high level of government intervention and further proposals for even greater intervention through EWC (Expropriation Without Compensation), NHI (National Health Insurance) etc. the Chairperson of Parliament's Select Committee on Trade and Industry, Economic Development, Tourism Employment and Labour, Mandla Rayi, is proposing even greater government intervention in order to stop the job losses.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It seems clear that the political leaders of this country have yet to learn the lesson that while government intervention may feel good in the short-term, eventually someone always has to pay the piper. If the legislature tries to legislate away retrenchments, companies that need to cut costs to survive will simply go out of business. And more workers will become jobless.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The only other option, if we are talking about greater government involvement in the economy, is yet another bailout. This is after bailouts to SOEs amounting to hundreds of billions with last year\'92s R59 billion bailout to Eskom on top of the R23 billion per year already budgeted. The PIC (Public Investment Corporation) and the UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund), both state entities, were responsible for supplying the lion\'92s share of a previous R2.7 billion bailout to EDCON, a private company.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If another bailout is on the cards, it will only make South Africa\'92s lamentable fiscal situation worse. The country\'92s debt-to-GDP rocketed to more than 60% sooner than Treasury provided for in the 2019 February budget, the increase from 56% to 60% mainly caused by the bailout to Eskom. As we speak, the government is desperately trying to find the necessary funds to keep its commitment of a further R2 billion capitalisation of SAA as part of the business rescue process.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If politicians truly understood the magnitude of the fiscal crisis facing the country, there would be no proposals for additional spending but rather how to cut government expenditure. The risks to the present and the future are great. Economist Mike Schussler wrote recently in Moneyweb about how the bond yield premium on South African long-term bonds relative to our emerging market peers has increased from 1.6% to 3.7% since the end of President Thabo Mbeki\'92s term of office.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Remember, interest on government debt can only be funded through revenue and not debt. This means bond yields are increasing in an environment where tax revenue, as a percentage of GDP, has been stagnant at 26% since 2008. The wider the fiscal deficit, the more revenue the state needs to raise through taxes. Given the aforementioned (increasing bond yields and stagnant tax revenue growth), this is simply not possible, bringing forward the possibility of a technical default, where the government cannot service its debt.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There are some actions the government could take to help the economy recover, but they are not quick and easy. These include deregulating the economy, especially the labour market. There should also be significant cuts in government spending as well as reductions in taxes, especially payroll and corporate income taxes.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This would also mean letting companies that are in trouble fail. Every job saved via a government bailout diverts capital from productive investment in another area of the economy. This misallocation of resources eventually adds up and results in even bigger net job losses in the future. Given the raft of retrenchment stories making the news, we are now paying for years of loose fiscal policy.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the interest of all South Africans, it is time the government started listening to the rational voices in society. The policies of onerous regulation, bailouts and loose fiscal policy have led us to where we are. Albert Einstein is rumoured to have said, \'93The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\'94. Let us hope that sanity returns for the sake of the future of every South African child.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nos \'faltimos anos, termos como big data, 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  e intelig\'eancia artificial entraram de vez na pauta tecnol\'f3gica e no ambiente corporativo. Se antes o uso deste tipo de ferramenta era acess\'f3rio, em um mundo cada vez mais digital, elas se tornaram fundamentais para o desenvolvimento dos neg\'f3cios e para a competitividade das empresas. Em evento realizado em parceria entre o Imil e a Casa Firjan, especialistas no tema falaram sobre a gest\'e3o de reputa\'e7\'e3o de uma empresa e o impacto dessas tecnologias no mercado.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Neste contexto, quem aproveitar as oportunidades que a tecnologia oferece sai na frente. \'c9 o que sustenta o CEO da Eight e especialista do Instituto Millenium, Leandro Bortolassi. \'93Muito mais que desafio, isso traz oportunidade. A partir do momento em que a empresa conseguir domar a tecnologia, vai trazer competitividade, vai poder recrutar utilizando a intelig\'eancia e melhorar a gest\'e3o da marca. Com isso, o trabalho fica muito mais eficiente em termos de planejamento estrat\'e9gico e execu\'e7\'e3o operacional\'94, disse.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 O diretor associado do GroupCaliber Latin America, Dario Menezes, destacou, por outro lado, que estamos vivendo em um mundo onde a experi\'eancia de uma pessoa influencia a outra. \'93Se eu pensar em viajar para o Jap\'e3o, por exemplo, eu vou ser muito pouco influenciado pela comunica\'e7\'e3o de uma empresa e muito mais pelas dicas de quem j\'e1 foi l\'e1 e viu o que \'e9 bom e o que n\'e3o \'e9. Tudo mudou nas organiza\'e7\'f5es, a gente vive em um contexto de hiperconex\'e3o. Algumas j\'e1 entenderam e outras ainda vivem em um ciclo auto-ilus\'f3rio\'94, afirmou.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nos \'faltimos anos, termos como big data, 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  e intelig\'eancia artificial entraram de vez na pauta tecnol\'f3gica e no ambiente corporativo. Se antes o uso deste tipo de ferramenta era acess\'f3rio, em um mundo cada vez mais digital, elas se tornaram fundamentais para o desenvolvimento dos neg\'f3cios e para a competitividade das empresas. Em evento realizado em parceria entre o Imil e a Casa Firjan, especialistas no tema falaram sobre a gest\'e3o de reputa\'e7\'e3o de uma organiza\'e7\'e3o e o impacto dessas tecnologias no mercado.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Neste contexto, quem aproveitar as oportunidades que a tecnologia oferece sai na frente. \'c9 o que sustenta o CEO da Eight e especialista do Instituto Millenium, Leandro Bortolassi. \'93Muito mais que desafio, isso traz oportunidade. A partir do momento em que a empresa conseguir domar a tecnologia, vai trazer competitividade, vai poder recrutar utilizando a intelig\'eancia e melhorar a gest\'e3o da marca. Com isso, o trabalho fica muito mais eficiente em termos de planejamento estrat\'e9gico e execu\'e7\'e3o operacional\'94, disse.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 O diretor associado do GroupCaliber Latin America, Dario Menezes, destacou, por outro lado, que estamos vivendo em um mundo onde a experi\'eancia de uma pessoa influencia a outra. \'93Se eu pensar em viajar para o Jap\'e3o, por exemplo, eu vou ser muito pouco influenciado pela comunica\'e7\'e3o de uma empresa e muito mais pelas dicas de quem j\'e1 foi l\'e1 e viu o que \'e9 bom e o que n\'e3o \'e9. Tudo mudou nas organiza\'e7\'f5es, a gente vive em um contexto de hiperconex\'e3o. Algumas j\'e1 entenderam e outras ainda vivem em um ciclo auto-ilus\'f3rio\'94, afirmou.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Economic freedom correlates strongly with economic growth. There is no longer any doubt about this for anyone who witnessed the extraordinary rise of the countries in the former Eastern Bloc after the fall of the former Soviet Union.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Countries like Estonia and Georgia have experienced unparalleled increases in prosperity along with economic freedom as reflected in their ranking in the most recent Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) annual report.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Indeed, Estonia is considered a technological hub rivaled only by Silicon Valley in the United States.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Closer to home, Rwanda is now the hottest investment destination on the African continent. It has rocketed past South Africa in the EFW to fill 2nd position on the continent after Mauritius.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This has led to that country being consistently one of the top five fastest growing economies in the world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That Rwandans are now even producing their own smartphones is quite extraordinary when you consider that the country was experiencing the worst genocide since the holocaust around the same time that South Africa was becoming a democracy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If we look at the graph below showing the two countries' performance according to EFW, we see that Rwanda surpassed South Africa between 2007 and 2008.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Rwanda is not only at a higher point than South Africa but is also trending upwards while South Africa is trending downwards in terms of economic freedom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If we look at the GDP per capita growth for both nations, we see that since surpassing South Africa, that not only has Rwanda had higher annual rates of growth, but South Africa has not come close to matching Rwanda's growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In fact, the last time this happened was in 2003, the same year that South Africa reached its highest recorded Economic Freedom score under President Thabo Mbeki.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The EFW index is divided into 5 areas which contain 43 component variables. Between 17 and 19 July, the Free Market Foundation (FMF) will be hosting an Economic Freedom audit of South Africa.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There will be five sessions representing the five areas of the EFW, during which South African experts in those areas will chair discussions between government representatives and the international researchers who compile the annual EFW index.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We hope this will allow policy-makers to see how the EFW can be used in their own specific areas of competence towards reaching the larger development goals that government has set for the country.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The EFW is comprehensive, so any ministry will find variables that apply specifically to their area of competence, whether it's the budget (Area 1: Size of government), the judiciary and property rights (Area 2: Legal system and property rights), protecting the value of the rand (Area 3: Sound money), attracting FDI (Area 4: Freedom to trade internationally) and the rules that small business owners have to comply with (Area 5: Regulation).

\f2\fs20 Bonang Mohale, former CEO of Business Leadership South Africa and Free Market Luminary Award recipient, will host the session on freedom to trade on the 18 July.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Former judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa, Rex van Schalkwyk, will chair the session on the Legal System and Property Rights on 19 July. These are just two of the experts who will be participating in this enlightening and exciting seminar.

\f2\fs20 If we are serious about solving the myriad developmental challenges facing this country, we need to start thinking about adopting the policies that are known to cause higher levels of economic growth and prosperity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I hope to see you at the audit event. I have said before that policy-makers should start benchmarking policy against useful indices like EFW.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We have seen in our comparison between South Africa and Rwanda just how important this one index is for predicting which economy will grow "much faster than the population."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is the very thing that President Ramaphosa has highlighted as being the main focus of his government for the next five years.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The 2014 Rule of Law Index report has this to say about the importance of the rule of law to a country's business environment:
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 "Imagine an investor seeking to commit resources abroad. She would probably think twice before investing in a country where corruption is rampant, property rights are ill-defined, and contracts are difficult to enforce. Uneven enforcement of regulations, corruption, insecure property rights, and ineffective means to settle disputes undermine legitimate business and drive away both domestic and foreign investment." (Rule of Law Index (2014), World Justice Project)
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What this makes clear is that the rule of law is a necessary prerequisite for economic progress. An essential component of the rule of law is the existence of impartial courts where disputes are resolved fairly without favouritism to one of the parties. This is important for the economic welfare of individuals in a country because no modern economy can survive without individual property rights or contracts.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report seeks to measure the impartiality of courts in different countries. Through their executive survey, the data is collected and then used as one of the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) report's component variables. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I have done a regression analysis to determine the five most important components of the EFW in bringing about short-term (1 year) growth in the per capita GDP. It turns out that the impartial courts variable mentioned above is one of these. I found that maximising a country's score on this sub-component could add as much as 0.37 percentage points to GDP per capita growth. This is hardly surprising. Countries with courts that are subject to political persuasion are likely to prove inadequate in protecting private property against malicious government officials. In Zimbabwe, many white farmers appealed to the courts after their property had been seized by military veterans but law enforcement turned a blind eye, the courts were politically partial, and economic ruin soon followed.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 South Africa has done relatively well, ranking 34th in the world in terms of this sub-component. Given this country's urgent need to grow the economy, create wealth and get people out of poverty, the government should be aiming to take top spot in the world. Our current variable score is 5.45, while Finland, the top-ranked country, scores 7.98.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It's possible for us to have the highest score in the world if, for instance, we aim at depoliticising our judicial selection process as much as possible. While we have a reasonably high score relative to the continent (ranked 4th in Africa after Rwanda, Mauritius and Namibia), the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) process still has some political bias built-in due to the nature of the interview process. Another possible reform would be to require political parties to nominate legal professionals of suitable experience to serve on this crucial body rather than politicians.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Looking at the Finnish Judicial Appointments Board (JAB), their equivalent of our JSC is made up of members of the judiciary (seven representing the different types of Finnish courts), one advocate nominated by the bar association, one prosecutor nominated by the Prosecutor General, and one legal academic. In contrast, South Africa's JSC is made up of three members of the judiciary, two advocates, two attorneys, one professor of law, ten nominees from Parliament, and five nominees from the President which includes the Minister of Justice.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In other words, our twenty-three membered JSC has more political appointees (fifteen) than professional and academic appointments (eight). Finland's JAB is made up entirely of members of the judiciary, legal professionals, and a legal academic. This is something South Africa should learn from the Finns.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Making our courts impartial will not only help with growing the economy and raising living standards, it will also go a long way towards dealing with corruption. Of course, making our courts impartial, on its own, will not ensure the rule of law but given the importance of the rule of law in the economy, this would be as good a place to start as any.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 WASHINGTON, D.C., Jul 12, 2019 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) -- The Kapor Center announced the winners of its inaugural $1 million Tech Done Right Challenge grant competition, including the Washington D.C. non-profit, Byte Back. The challenge identified 10 social impact organizations who are building a more diverse and inclusive tech economy locally and nationally. Each winning organization will receive a $100,000 grant.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "We were thrilled with the number of strong applicants from all over the country for this timely challenge," remarked Cedric Brown, Chief Foundation Officer at the Kapor Center. "We're confident that these grants can propel the important work of these 10 organizations to the next level. Together we're moving toward a tech sector that provides robust opportunities for previously untapped and overlooked talent."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "Our economy has changed, and Byte Back is providing the training for individuals who have been left behind," said Elizabeth Lindsey, executive director of Byte Back. "Thanks to the Tech Done Right Challenge and our partnership with the Kapor Center, we're building a more equitable and inclusive tech sector. We're thinking differently about diversity, and together we're changing the face of tech."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Tech Done Right Challenge launched in March 2019 to galvanize cross-sector collaborations in cities across the U.S. to build diverse and inclusive tech ecosystems. A key requirement of the challenge is to find solutions that embrace innovation through prototypes, experimentation and iteration through public and private collaborations. The Tech Done Right Challenge is possible through the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The challenge asked organizations to answer: "What is your innovative solution to build a diverse and thriving inclusive tech ecosystem in your community?"
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Winning Organizations:

\f2\fs20 Winner Breakdown:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A total of 120 applications from 48 U.S. cities were submitted, focused on interventions at the Post-Secondary, Tech Workforce, and Entrepreneurship & Venture Capital segments. The 10 award winners come from a range of locations across the Midwest, the South, and from both coasts. All of the winning organizations focus on increasing representation of underrepresented people of color in our tech economy via tech talent or entrepreneurship/venture capital programs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Background:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2018 the Kapor Center released the Leaky Tech Pipeline, a research framework that identifies the systemic barriers which underlie the lack of diversity in tech. While the tech sector has the potential to bring jobs, innovation and wealth to communities, far too many women and people of color remain excluded from the technology economy as tech workers, founders or investors. The Tech Done Right Challenge seeks to reverse this trend by supporting trailblazers who have holistic solutions to build inclusive tech economies.

A 137\'aa edi\'e7\'e3o do projeto ser\'e1 realizada neste s\'e1bado (24), na Escola de Neg\'f3cios Trevisan \'96 RJ, \'e0s 10h, e contar\'e1 com a presen\'e7a da economista Zeina Latif abordando o tema da reforma da Previd\'eancia. J\'e1 na segunda-feira (26), \'e0s 19h, o cientista de dados V\'edtor Wilher falar\'e1 sobre o ensino superior sob a perspectiva liberal, na Universidade Federal do Cear\'e1. Esta ser\'e1 a 138\'aa edi\'e7\'e3o do programa, que visa discutir os valores importantes para a constru\'e7\'e3o de um Brasil mais pr\'f3spero e livre.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Na aula sobre Previd\'eancia, a economista Zeina Latif explicar\'e1 por que a reforma \'e9 essencial para manter o ambiente econ\'f4mico favor\'e1vel e abordar\'e1, tamb\'e9m, a quest\'e3o de que a medida, sozinha, n\'e3o trar\'e1 a volta instant\'e2nea do crescimento.

\f2\fs20 J\'e1 no Cear\'e1, V\'edtor Wilher lan\'e7ar\'e1 um novo olhar sobre o ensino superior. Para o especialista, ele deve ser pago por quem tem capacidade, sendo subsidiado apenas para os mais pobres. \'93Utilizarei dados da OCDE, Banco Mundial e INEP para mostrar que o Brasil investe muito em educa\'e7\'e3o superior e pouco em educa\'e7\'e3o b\'e1sica, gerando perpetua\'e7\'e3o da desigualdade social no pa\'eds\'94.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Al\'e9m disso, o cientista de dados falar\'e1 sobre o financiamento atual das universidades estatais. \'93Acredito que esse esquema gera incentivos perversos, culminando em pouco impacto dessas institui\'e7\'f5es no desenvolvimento econ\'f4mico, salvo as exce\'e7\'f5es de praxe\'94.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Following the discussions about the NHI (National Health Insurance), I am struck by how little regard is given to self-ownership. To preclude the possibility of ownership by someone else, self-ownership is a necessity. Black Africans were enslaved in the Americas because their self-ownership was not recognized.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Your right to own yourself is the basis of your freedom and not merely a tool to be used by others for achieving their own ends. Given this, the most immediate consequence of owning yourself is ownership of your own labor. This extends naturally then to what you can exchange for that labor.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Currently, in South Africa, many working people choose to exchange a part of their labor for a medical aid scheme that works best for them. This basic choice will be done away with when NHI comes into effect. There will then be only one payer, government, with the right to refuse to pay for something that you may previously have had covered. Tough luck, and they\'92ll take your money anyway. This translates into a part of your labor being stolen by the government under the guise of it being for \'93the good of the people\'94.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To compound the problem, medical schemes have reserves which belong to the members of the schemes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The concept of social solidarity is a sneaky way of appropriating your freedom to choose what to do with your labor and how to run your life. It implies that the government owns you if there\'92s a great enough need. Will there come a day when these people make the case that total, instead of partial, slavery is acceptable if a great enough need has been established?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To compound the problem, medical schemes have reserves which belong to the members of the schemes. There has been no clarity from the government as to what will happen to those reserves when medical aid schemes become defunct or are reduced in terms of the scope of what they can cover. If these reserves are transferred to the NHI, it will mean the accumulated property (the product of their labor) of medical scheme members will simply be stolen, that\'92s what we call it when your property is taken against your will.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The NHI does not only imply that medical aid scheme members and taxpayers are nothing more than a means towards government ends, but it also implies that doctors and other healthcare workers do not own their own labor. As a single-payer, the government will effectively decide how much these people can earn for their services. If they refuse the government price, no matter how good they are at their job, they will simply have no patients sent their way.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not to say taxing individuals to fund the voucher program is moral. It just means that we recognize that poor people are in the position they are in because of government policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These are only some of the implications of an NHI. This is not to say we should just ignore the plight of the poor in this country \'96 those people who have been slaves to government whim due to being unable to sell their labor under conditions of their own choosing, or having their property rights unrecognized because the government would much rather appease traditional leaders. This is why something like a voucher system for healthcare is necessary as a temporary measure until these violations of the human rights of the poor are rectified.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With a voucher system, a poor person would no longer be forced to use state hospitals and be subjected to their shocking record of service. Instead, they would have the choice as to which healthcare provider to use, as well as how the service is to be paid for, unlike under the NHI. South Africa has a poverty crisis precisely because the poor are not trusted with choices. No single group in South Africa has its natural right to self-ownership undermined as much as poor people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not to say taxing individuals to fund the voucher program is moral. It just means that we recognize that poor people are in the position they are in because of government policy. Just like we did when it comes to the land restitution program. The program would not only be time-limited but also conditional on labor market reform. It would have to be accompanied by a general liberalization of the economy to enable the poorest among us to make it onto the first rung of the economic ladder and eventually afford their own healthcare.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is unfortunate that the country finds itself in this position given the hope for freedom that was present in 1994. As a black person, the greater degree of self-ownership I have achieved under this government could never have happened under the apartheid regime. This is not a favor that the government did for me, it was simply the restoration of my natural birthright. In the same way that the blood and treasure (savings and capital stock) lost in the American civil war was a necessary price to pay for restoring to those who were enslaved their natural rights.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Following the discussions about the NHI (National Health Insurance), I am struck by how little regard is given to self-ownership. To preclude the possibility of ownership by someone else, self-ownership is a necessity. Black Africans were enslaved in the Americas because their self-ownership was not recognised.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Your right to own yourself is the basis of your freedom and not merely a tool to be used by others for achieving their own ends. Given this, the most immediate consequence of owning yourself is ownership of your own labour. This extends naturally then to what you can exchange for that labour.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Currently, in South Africa, many working people choose to exchange a part of their labour for a medical aid scheme that works best for them. This basic choice will be done away with when NHI comes into effect. There will then be only one payer, government, with the right to refuse to pay for something that you may previously have had covered. Tough luck, and they\'92ll take your money anyway. This translates into a part of your labour being stolen by the government under the guise of it being for \'93the good of the people\'94.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The concept of social solidarity is a sneaky way of appropriating your freedom to choose what to do with your labour and how to run your life. It implies that the government owns you if there\'92s a great enough need. Will there come a day when these people make the case that total, instead of partial, slavery is acceptable if a great enough need has been established?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To compound the problem, medical schemes have reserves which belong to the members of the schemes. There has been no clarity from the government as to what will happen to those reserves when medical aid schemes become defunct or are reduced in terms of the scope of what they can cover. If these reserves are transferred to the NHI, it will mean the accumulated property (the product of their labour) of medical scheme members will simply be stolen, that\'92s what we call it when your property is taken against your will.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The NHI does not only imply that medical aid scheme members and taxpayers are nothing more than a means towards government ends, it also implies that doctors and other healthcare workers do not own their own labour. As a single-payer, the government will effectively decide how much these people can earn for their services. If they refuse the government price, no matter how good they are at their job, they will simply have no patients sent their way.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These are only some of the implications of an NHI. This is not to say we should just ignore the plight of the poor in this country - those people who have been slaves to government whim due to being unable to sell their labour under conditions of their own choosing, or having their property rights unrecognised because the government would much rather appease traditional leaders. This is why something like a voucher system for healthcare is necessary as a temporary measure until these violations of the human rights of the poor are rectified.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With a voucher system, a poor person would no longer be forced to use state hospitals and be subjected to their shocking record of service. Instead, they would have the choice as to which healthcare provider to use, as well as how the service is to be paid for, unlike under the NHI. South Africa has a poverty crisis precisely because the poor are not trusted with choices. No single group in South Africa has its natural right to self-ownership undermined as much as poor people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not to say taxing individuals to fund the voucher programme is moral. It just means that we recognise that poor people are in the position they are in because of government policy. Just like we did when it comes to the land restitution programme. The programme would not only be time-limited but also conditional on labour market reform. It would have to be accompanied by a general liberalisation of the economy to enable the poorest among us to make it onto the first rung of the economic ladder and eventually afford their own healthcare.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is unfortunate that the country finds itself in this position given the hope for freedom that was present in 1994. As a black person, the greater degree of self-ownership I have achieved under this government could never have happened under the apartheid regime. This is not a favour that the government did for me, it was simply the restoration of my natural birthright. In the same way that the blood and treasure (savings and capital stock) lost in the American civil war was a necessary price to pay for restoring to those who were enslaved their natural rights.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 South Africa\'92s state-owned enterprises are the likely reason why government will go bankrupt.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Besides the biggest culprit, Eskom, which will be receiving a R230-billion bailout over the next few years, many other SOEs are also in trouble.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 One that has managed to fly under the radar is SA Express.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 All of us know about SAA\'92s problems, but just to reinforce that they really can\'92t run an airline, SA Express also appears to be in serious financial trouble.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 SA Express (SAX) has not released a set of audited financial statements since 2016 yet received a government bailout of R1.24 billion in November 2018.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South African taxpayers are being forced to throw money at something without knowing how it will be spent due to the lack of transparency.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is an outrage but, sadly, we seem to have become quite accustomed to doing this.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The problems with SOEs highlights the folly of governments that own companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To keep them running, governments have to plug them into an involuntary source of funds that is then spent by people to whom the funds do not belong.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 You might think that democracy would be an adequate check but, in South Africa, with more than a 38% rate of unemployment (the expanded definition of unemployment), it is clear that the majority of the population do not pay taxes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is interesting that the government has a Competition Commission meant to act against anti-competitive behaviour, and, at the same time, also engages in this kind of behaviour.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What else should we call it when government props up its own companies because it is beyond them to compete against other companies in the market?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Companies that compete for survival are the very same people government taxes to fund its SOEs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That last line might seem like an exaggeration but think about it. You can buy shares in a private company and become a part owner.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For example, the biggest (by market capitalisation) private company on the JSE is AB Inbev. You can buy a share for around R1,500 excluding broker fees and taxes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not true of any SOE \'96 including SAX.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is reasonable, therefore, to say that government is using our money to subsidise companies competing against us.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When a private company doesn\'92t release a set of audited statements like SAX has failed to do, no sane investor will give that company money.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But SAX has no need to worry. The government has access to as much of our money as it deems necessary.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Do you recall how the Steinhoff share price tumbled when the company failed to release audited results?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is the beauty of the market. Bad behaviour is punished, inefficiency is not tolerated.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is the very opposite of what happens when the government is the owner.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In December 2018, after receiving R1.24 billion from the government, the SAX CEO boasted that they would be cutting prices by 35% to 55% to compete with private players.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Of course, you can do this when you have billions in taxpayer funds backing you.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa is in an untenable fiscal situation due to irresponsible choices by politicians.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We simply cannot afford to continue subsidising companies like SAX which has been running at a loss since at least 2011.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not all companies deserve to be saved. Imagine if we tried to save every company in the JSE.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Besides costing a lot of money, it would make the South African economy bloated and inefficient.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The truth is, letting inefficient companies fail is an important part of how the market drives efficiency.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Companies that cannot fail because they have unlimited subsidies from the taxpayer can only become more and more inefficient and require further bailouts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If we cannot allow SOEs to fail when they are inefficient, then the services and products they produce will balloon in cost and those companies will need a never-ending stream of bailouts.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Labour unions are undoubtedly the biggest obstacle to any positive reform, not because this particular group of individuals is somehow more evil than the rest of us. It is simply a rational response to the particular set of incentives that union bosses are faced with.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions are nominally democratic but their members face the same problems any voter faces in any representative democracy: the benefits of electing a given leader are concentrated while the costs are dispersed. This means that while every union member pays the same dues, this individual contribution is outweighed by the potential return due to elected officials in the form of salaries and controlling the union's invested funds.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Add to this the fact that the full negative consequences of union action is only felt by its members after decades, and it is easy to see why unions might not always promote the interests of those they supposedly represent. Therefore members of unions should seriously consider making changes to how their organisations are governed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is an internal union issue though and it is unlikely to make unions the sort of persistent thorn in South Africa's side it has been. The real problem with unions is the political favouritism they have been receiving from government. It has magnified any internal governance issues and dealt a serious blow to the hopes of millions of poor people in this country.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions have a lot going for them in South Africa. The only equivalently favoured class of people are likely the tenderpreneurs. Unions are in a political alliance with the ruling party for one, this means that they have the equivalent of a veto on that party's policies. As long as both parties want to stay in alliance they have to take seriously what the other wants. This becomes particularly perverse when considering the role of education unions in thwarting any attempt at introducing meritocracy in the schools that your children have to attend.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unions also have collective bargaining, this is a tool that allows employers and union representatives to set the conditions of employment for millions of workers in a particular sector. None of the parties involved in such an endeavour need consider the interests of the unemployed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In fact, when it comes to unionised workers, there are good reasons not to consider the interests of the unemployed. Considering labour as one of the factors of production with an associated price like any of the others, it is clear after taking account of the law of supply and demand, that the best way unions can negotiate for higher wages for their members is through restricting the supply of labour. How can this be achieved in a country with an unemployment rate of 37%, including people who have given up looking for work?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It turns out that this is where the aforementioned alliance with the ruling party really makes a difference. You see, unions have the ability to negotiate conditions of employment which make things better for their current, employed members by making it harder for the unemployed to get jobs. One way to do this is through the minimum wage which disproportionately affects unskilled and young, inexperienced workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When minimum wages are instituted, it removes any justification for hiring new workers at a rate not justified by that worker's productivity. On the other hand, some of the company's unionised workforce will not have the required productivity levels, meaning that the cost of sustaining these unproductive jobs will be passed on to consumers. This is because unions have also negotiated for themselves obstacles to firing their members.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 You would think that this anti-competitive behaviour would be enough but it gets worse. South Africa has a state that plays a big role in the economy through government procurement as well as state-owned enterprises. Being allied with the government means that this is one more area where unions have influence.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We are seeing this play out with Eskom. The government, through the President, announced a planned restructuring of the company in which it would be split into three parts. The biggest unions operating within Eskom opposed this as a step towards privatisation and possible job losses. Soon after the announcement Eskom started stage 4 load-shedding. The government 'clarified' that no retrenchments would result from the planned restructuring and coincidentally, the load-shedding stopped.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not to say that unions had any role in precipitating the blackouts but their firm opposition to retrenchments at all costs means that what they are really saying is that the rest of the country, including poor and unemployed South Africans, should pay higher electricity prices if necessary, if that's what it takes to save their members' jobs. It is not so much that they would make this rationally self-interested call, rather it is that they have more influence than you or I in making it. Lobbying for the poor is bad for business, they tend not to pay monthly membership dues.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What is the cause of poverty? And what would be the solution?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 These are questions that have shaped my thoughts for some time now. In this article, I present some of my thinking, along with some data to back my views.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I am filled with rage when I see how many people, especially in my native Zululand, are poor, with KwaZulu-Natal having the greatest share of South Africa's poor households at 20.6%, according to the Living Conditions Survey 2014/15 released by Stats SA in March 2018.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The share of the South African population living in KwaZulu-Natal is steadily decreasing from 20.1% in 2014 to 19.7% in 2018. KwaZulu-Natal was one of four provinces - Free State, Eastern Cape and Limpopo - that have experienced a decline in their population share.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Of these four provinces, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo experienced negative net-migration between 2011 and 2016. And they have the most tribal/communal land. They also happen to have 47.9% of South Africa's poor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Why, then, is it that the good people of KwaZulu-Natal keep failing to identify and address the source of their poverty? The Western Cape, for example, is the third most populated province but is seventh in terms of share of the country's poor. KwaZulu-Natal is first even though the population share is decreasing while the Western Cape's population share increased from 11.2% to 11.8% between 2014 and 2018.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Its net migration between 2011 and 2016 was positive, making it the second highest after Gauteng.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 KwaZulu-Natal has the greatest concentration of this country's largest minority group: IsiZulu language speakers - 25.3% of all South Africans speak the language in the home. The next most-spoken home language is isiXhosa, lying a distant second with 14.8% of home language speakers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In terms of the incidence of poverty, KwaZulu-Natal is fourth in the country after Limpopo, Eastern Cape and the North West - four provinces that are virtually home to all the country's communal land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Meanwhile, the Western Cape has the lowest incidence of poverty and has no communal land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Also of interest is that the poorest provinces receive a bigger share of financial transfers per person living in the province from the national government and yet the distribution of poverty has remained more or less constant. Surely it's a matter of great surprise for government central planners that people, voting with their feet, are leaving provinces with the greatest per capita government expenditure that have a lower level of per capita government expenditure.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So, large populations don't make provinces poorer. Government expenditure does not seem to be making provinces any better off. And the poorest provinces just happen to be the ones with most of the communal land, or, dead capital according to economist Hernando De Soto.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To hammer the point home, Gauteng and the Western Cape received 19.9% and 10.1%, respectively, of the provincial equitable share from the National Treasury in 2018/19. Gauteng was home to a projected 25.5% of the population according to Stats SA's 2018 mid-year population estimate. The Western Cape was home to 11.5% of the population.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Meanwhile, the Eastern Cape received 13.93% of the allocation for a population share of 11.3%, and Limpopo 11.73% of the allocation for a population share of 10.0%.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When it comes to the macroeconomy, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape had the top three GDP numbers in South Africa in 2013, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Yet, when it comes to GDP per capita during the same year, Gauteng still leads but KwaZulu-Natal slips from second to seventh in the country while the Western Cape moves up one spot from third to second.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The living conditions survey shows that communal land is home to 43.2% of the country's poor people while only 5% of households are classified as traditional. The formal/informal households are largely found in urban areas
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 All of this says, private property rights matter. The stronger property rights are, the more likely individuals are to be wealthier, healthier and, hopefully, happier, and, therefore, we can say that pursuing land expropriation without compensation is an anti-poor policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Poor people benefit from a system of secure property rights and they understand this, if not consciously, then sub-consciously, as can be observed from the fact that the poor move to the provinces where property rights are most secure.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If government is interested in making a dent in poverty, one of the steps that needs to be taken is the immediate abandonment of land expropriation without compensation as a policy goal.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The next step should be to strengthen property rights for everyone, especially the poor by giving them title deeds to their own land. Clearly, trying to solve poverty by throwing money at the problem is a useless endeavour as evidenced by the fact that supposed beneficiaries of taxpayer-funded largesse prefer to live in provinces with lower per capita spending by government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We also see that the type of tenure existing on tribal land in the former homelands keeps individuals living in those areas poor. It is not enough to defeat land expropriation without compensation. Poor people on communal land also need their property rights to be restored to them and their neighbours.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A system of secure property rights benefits even those who do not own property because of the commercial activity generated when people can use their assets to trade, finance and generally engage in long-term economic planning. This explains the migration from communal KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape to Gauteng and the Western Cape with their relatively secure property rights.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the converse holds: if property rights are made less secure, through land expropriation without compensation for example, government gains even more power to interfere with the property rights of individuals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It becomes harder to engage in long-term economic planning since any money spent acquiring the property and making improvements can simply disappear into thin air when a bureaucrat comes calling backed up by nothing more than the arbitrary notion of public interest.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The problem here is that "the public" is made up of millions of individuals each with their own unique values and interests. We can only expect to see more people becoming poor when property rights are watered down, no matter what the legal wording that enables this says.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But, this time the poor will not have to move to a Gauteng or a Western Cape because conditions there will be no different from where they're already living.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Much has been written already on Number 10 adviser Dominic Cummings\'92 New Year appeal to \'93assorted weirdos\'94 to smash up, then rebuild government to make it better. Cato economist Ryan Bourne challenges it from a public choice perspective, left-leaning professor Jonathan Portes on whether he has picked the right targets in civil servants rather than their ministers, and Len Shackleton of this parish on doing less being more important than doing it better \'96 all good points and exactly the kind of \'93red team\'94 review Cummings says he likes for challenging his thinking.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Cummings\'92 piece is complex, referencing his own back catalogue of thinking on the state and politics, the reading of which is essential for anyone thinking of applying. I am therefore going to focus more narrowly on the microeconomics references in the piece, bad Nash equilibriums in Game Theory and Bayesian inference. The former, in this context, is \'93the problem\'94 \'96 why does government keep failing to deliver big projects on time and on budget, and then never learn from its mistakes \'96 or more rarely successes \'96 to do better in future? The latter is a mathematical tool for updating our beliefs, based on evidence that when applied repetitively, particularly via machine learning within Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, then communicated effectively in the right environment for maximum impact, might enable government to make better decisions, faster.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is contrasted with asking a generalist senior \'93public school bluffer\'94 with no expertise or evidence for their best guess, and getting an answer that approximates to what they think you want to hear, while they assiduously bury bad news, then promoting them for their wisdom in not rocking the boat, rather than any evidence of competence or concern for public service. That at least appears to be his characterisation of the culture he is trying to change, while recognising the efforts of \'93brilliant individuals\'94 within the system who are trying to help.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In brief, Cummings cites evidence that megaprojects (>$1 billion in cost) run by all types of government often fail and fail for reasons that are often repeated. From defence procurement to tackling climate change to lifelong learning, bad decisions are made, bad projects contrived, with bad leadership, which are then badly run, to the lingering harm of the public and any future governments now saddled with both the debts from failure and personnel trained to repeat it. \'a0Nothing changes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Worse, government culture is designed to repel disruptive innovators who might do better, and in political leadership there is a willingness to \'93fail conventionally\'94 rather than risk ridicule for thinking differently, even if that might yield longer-term success. It is not hard to see his experience of trying to reform the Department for Education in the Cameron era as shaping these thoughts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The bad Nash equilibriums in this context are the assured failures of government projects due to the structure of incentives and interplay of decisions and actors that lead to them. Their repetition suggests current government learning strategies such as project reviews do not work, the incentives don\'92t change, the people don\'92t change (or rather the type of person doesn\'92t \'96 too rapid change of personnel is part of the complaint, as is groupthink). Repetitive failure then is baked into the way government works, or rather does not work. Cummings does not believe it needs to be this way. What if small teams of highly able people, selected for their brilliance were able to sit outside the conventional structures of government and do things differently, encouraging change by example?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is not entirely novel: Cummings cites examples of \'93getting it right\'94 through successful megaprojects in history such as the Apollo and Manhattan Projects, although he notes their success was not sustained, in no small part due to the departure of visionary leaders, which begs a question as to why he thinks he can make himself redundant in a year. What is new is his particular take, applied to the modern context, particularly around the adoption of AI to improve project decisions and organisational learning within the machinery of the state. He wants brilliant minds in 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , software, economics, policy, communications and project management, unconventional enough to embrace concepts from each other\'92s disciplines (something Hayek was rather good at), while well managed enough to be focused on delivery, cognisant as to how their contribution contributes to whatever overarching objective they are set. It\'92s an exciting idea and a challenge to free-marketeers who believe that government, and particularly big government, is generally doomed to fail.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In Game Theory a bad outcome\'a0can be avoided by co-operation, changing incentives or breaking the game. Cummings I suspect is trying to do all three. Co-operation here means at one level cutting through departmental silos and the culture of \'93failing and moving on\'94 to force government to learn from its mistakes. This is more organisational than technical, but within projects better communication is part of the process of how incentives can be changed. In a repetitive game we learn from our mistakes, but this only makes a difference if we can communicate that learning to other decision makers. How we learn is where Bayesian inference is important. If we believe we know the probability of an event and receive new information, we apply that information to update our assessment of probability. This inference then updates our calculation of pay-offs (or incentives) and might lead to us making a different decision. If we can convey that change to the other decision makers we can avoid the certainty of second best, and change the \'93minimax\'94 culture where we seek to avoid losses rather than pursue success. At least I think that\'92s what he\'92s saying.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bayesian inference more mundanely is a mathematical way of modelling how people think and importantly how they change their minds. That it is mathematical and repeated at scale, a computational challenge, makes it central to AI. Machines use maths, we use hunches, but those hunches are rooted in decades of acquired, processed and simplified memories, and how rapidly these can be accessed and compared \'96 or our intelligence, to inform our decisions about what to do. When these hunches prove to be correct we call it a good guess, and when they do so repetitively we call it knowledge or expertise. Artificial intelligence then is hunches with maths, repeated faster than any human can, to acquire knowledge from guessing faster, and in doing so inform better decisions \'96 at least in circumstances where that advantage can be established.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A relevant and current example of this is the tools Facebook and others use to improve the serving of digital adverts on social media. Ad-variants are constantly tested by the ad server, prioritising those that get the most likes or retweets, updating those priorities as people get bored and stop clicking. This is vastly more efficient than the way old media campaigns used to work, with instant feedback on advertising effectiveness rather than lengthy and costly market research measures providing planners with better hunches on concepts, and where and when to show them. Cummings doesn\'92t just believe this is revolutionary; he applied it to the Vote Leave campaign in 2015/16, claiming 98% of the marketing spend was on data-driven social media, whereas the politicians wanted to spend it on billboards. Nor does he claim this necessarily won the referendum, just that it was a far more effective use of resources than spending by the other side, and allowed him to prove a point about the skills he is seeking.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is less clear how Cummings can use his \'93misfits\'94 and these tools to achieve the outcome he desires in government. I can well imagine a new situation room in Downing Street that clearly and in real time visually explains to ministers why a corporate pitch to secure government funding for carbon capture and storage as a solution to climate change is doomed to failure in the UK, not just in the form presented but in a range of realistic scenarios rooted in evidence that largely point to Chinese leadership. I can well imagine them showing the returns possible from putting a fraction of that request into researching the extraction of biofuels from GM algae in solar tubes, without subsidising the pilot. But both those conclusions are possible now with conventional planning tools, albeit less engagingly presented. That though may be crucial to persuading a minister with attention deficit disorder and an inbuilt phobia for scary words to make a tough decision, with fewer opportunities for hi-vis jacket photographs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I can imagine this team finding aspects of government activities, for example the processing of welfare payments, where machine learning could seriously improve the avoidance of harmful errors, and the training of staff in how to avoid them. But I\'92m not sure this constitutes a megaproject. I can imagine them applying some of these approaches to concurrent trade negotiations, ensuring each bilateral trade team is acutely aware of the trade-offs being requested by different potential partners and the quantum impact on UK exports and consumer choice. These could be genuinely revolutionary approaches that have serious impact. I could imagine attempts to scrap all ministerial and high-level civil service salaries, replacing them with incentive schemes linked to agreed evidence of actual success. I could imagine linking MPs\'92 pay to the state of the economy rather than their own notions of their importance relative to benchmark wealth creators and public servants. That might address aspects of the political incentives problem, at least until replaced by gender-pay gap targets by the next woke government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is then possible to see this as being quite ground-breaking and positive \'96 that is if the Cummings disruptors can overcome resistance, and are allowed to fail as well as succeed, which they assuredly will from time to time (and this will trigger the politicians to try and shut them down).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There are though other issues, some alluded to in the opening links. It\'92s not obvious in some cases that the issue is the culture of government, more that the government is involved at all. We don\'92t clearly need state planning of agriculture in the 2020s and there is no big question of food security to solve as was feared in the 1940s, yielding nearly a century of ill-conceived interventions and malinvestment. Is climate change a mega-project or has making it a mega-project rather than a market been a major cause of failure to address it?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is also the economic calculation problem, a test that should be applied to all the claims of big tech sales pitches as much as it was applied to the illusions of socialist central planning. Is the issue really either an insufficiency of data, the failure to use data to drive better decisions, or not having scientists involved; or is it that technocratic allocation, however sophisticated, is the wrong approach? In the NHS for example, it\'92s quite fun to imagine replacing NICE (the body that decides what drugs you can queue to receive in the hope you get them before being maimed or killed by waiting) with an AI immune to the entreaties of lobbyists. But it\'92s not clear why you\'92d do that rather than simply recognising other competent authorities and their recommendations, thereby allowing their sale more widely in the UK, potentially broadening access to better, cheaper treatments and therapies at a stroke. The AI\'92s decisions would still kill people and \'93the computer says no\'94 is unlikely to appease the voters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It would be good then if the future Downing Street Red Team included a few non-Reds to ask the difficult questions of any project proposal, \'93should we be doing this?\'94 and \'93what if we did nothing?\'94, with their conclusions regularly published.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If that were a part of the project, alongside better managed mega missions, both could be genuinely transformative.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The latest GDP numbers show that the South African economy declined by 3.2% for the first quarter of 2019. This comes after President Ramaphosa announced a R50 billion stimulus package in September 2018. Since that stimulus followed on a decade of stimulus spending instituted since the 2008 global economic crisis, we must now ask whether Minister Pravin Gordhan's decision to choose stimulus over austerity was the right one.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Of course, these dire GDP numbers also reflect the failure of Eskom to provide a reliable electricity supply. For this we must thank the department of energy's IRP document which didn't provide for deregulating the energy sector. South Africa is currently facing the consequences of bad government decision-making across the board. The twin evils of government spending (which means high taxes) and regulation are harming the economy.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In just the first quarter of 2019 we have seen increases in liquidations, insolvencies and unemployment. At the same time exports have decreased by 26.4% and gross fixed capital formation by 4.5% (the fifth consecutive decline) meaning that the investments needed to set the stage for future growth are declining in real terms. I believe it is not an exaggeration to say South Africa is de-industrialising.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa has yet to come out of the recession of 2009. This despite the finance minister of the time, Pravin Gordhan, launching the process that would take government debt from 22.6% of GDP and bump it up to the current 55.6% of GDP. Instead of being a bulwark against the "nine wasted years", the minister was a key enabler of the looting and economic stagnation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the meantime, countries like Estonia that chose the harder, less popular road of fiscal austerity have recovered and are creating jobs and participating in the fourth industrial revolution instead of trying to hide behind empty rhetoric. Estonia in 2009 experienced a decline of 14.72% in GDP while South Africa experienced a decline of a mere 1.54%. The Estonian government cut spending, including salaries of civil servants, while South Africa increased spending, especially on civil servants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The result is that Estonia grew by 3.9% in 2018, their third consecutive year of above 3% growth. South Africa meanwhile grew by 0.8% in 2018 and last experienced 3% growth in 2011. Correspondingly, South Africa went from 82nd in the world in 2008 to 110th in 2016 in the Economic Freedom of the World index produced by the Fraser Institute.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To make matters worse, in South Africa, signs of reform are nowhere to be found. The government is pursuing policies such as Expropriation Without Compensation (EWC) in an environment where private sector investment is in decline. As the President's intervention of 2018 shows, the "new dawn" president is just as committed to fiscal stimulus as his predecessor was. There are no signs that anyone in government has the political will to cut spending on the civil service and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in particular.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Indeed, Minister Gordhan, unlike Minister Mboweni, has expressed a misguided hope that the Soviet and apartheid era dinosaurs that are our SOEs can be transformed into profitable business concerns. He has done this while overruling the Eskom board and management for trying to introduce reforms i.e., refusing to increase the pay of Eskom's bloated workforce. Those who hope that President Ramaphosa can take a leaf from Margaret Thatcher's book, should remember that there's a reason why James Callaghan and Harold Wilson failed: The Labour Party was allied to the trade unions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is telling that only three sectors grew this quarter. One of these is government which added 0.2 percentage points to the GDP. The mere fact that government is included in the growth numbers is an aberration. Government can only grow at the expense of every other part of the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is because government grows only when it taxes our productive endeavours. It doesn't need to provide any value to consumers or convince them not to buy from any other entity. If government is a sector of the economy, it is one that grows at the point of a gun, benefitting from behaviour that is illegal if done by anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To further illustrate the de-industrialisation point, manufacturing was the biggest contributor to the drop in GDP at -1.1 percentage points. The insecurity of energy supply is just one of the problems our government has saddled us with by moving at a snail's pace (if at all) towards allowing the willing and able private sector to pick up Eskom's slack.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most of our problems have been inflicted on us by the government, especially the decision to abandon the fiscal prudence of President Mbeki and Minister Trevor Manuel. South Africans will continue to suffer as long as the private sector is demonised and not allowed to do what it does best.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In South Africa, it is well known that women suffer the brunt of our many social and economic issues. This is largely how females are viewed across South African culture, rather than as a matter of law. According to the\'a0Economic Freedom of the World\'a0index, South Africa scores 1.0, the highest possible score, according to the gender adjustment variable. This variable measures the extent to which women are treated relative to men under the law.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not surprisingly, the bulk of countries that score poorly are in the Middle East. South Africa has full constitutionally-enshrined equality between men and women. A good thing too, since this is the second most important variable after low inflation for those countries that want to boost their economic growth.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 40 to 50 percent of men in South Africa have perpetrated physical violence against their partners; 1 in 5 women older than 18 has experienced physical violence and 3 women die at the hands of their partners every day. - Oxfam, 2017.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The last point comes from a regression analysis done of all 43\'a0Economic Freedom of the World\'a0variables in order to ascertain the impact on GDP per capita growth in a year. It was found that the difference between the most gender unequal countries and the most equal could be as much as 0.48 percentage points in terms of GDP per capita growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is hardly surprising. Putting up arbitrary restrictions on half of your economically active population is not a good idea. Arab countries that restrict women's rights to work and trade are learning this lesson the hard way.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In South Africa, official government policy may not discriminate against women and that should continue being the case. But we still have a problem with how women are viewed socially. This is not really a matter for government policy, but families, in particular, should strive to free girls and women from the burdens of patriarchal expectations. Girls can do anything they put their minds to, just like boys can.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is harder to measure the impact of culture on aggregate economic variables like GDP, but the same logic that explains the impact of oppressive (against women) laws on the economy, should still hold when discussing oppressive cultures. It is simply not a good idea to stop someone participating in the economy based on something other than that individual's competence, which is something only a free market can determine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Freedom is the birthright of us all, no matter what gender we belong to. Virtually every country on earth has a history of sexist economic restrictions. Only in the past century did this change, and we can only guess at the extent to which the global economy has been stunted by this short-sightedness.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa also needs to deal with threats to the rights of women, like male primogeniture under customary law. This is the practice by which female heirs are overlooked in favor of their male siblings or other male relatives. This cultural practice has undoubtedly had a negative effect on South Africa's economy despite our gender-neutral written laws.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Male primogeniture is a way of depriving women of their property rights. This becomes a particularly serious problem in areas where land is communally owned, where the traditional authority has effective control over who gets to use the land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If South Africans are serious about solving the problem of extreme poverty, getting to the point where women have\'a0de facto\'a0as well as\'a0de jure\'a0equality with men will be a critical part of achieving that. No country can overcome the magnitude of what South Africa and the rest of Africa need to deal with while tying one of its hands behind its back. Free women and free the economy, otherwise development and progress will remain a dream.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          A plan for blending the best aspects of American health care with market-based models\'a0abroad.Introduction
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb60\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The partisan debate about health reform in America is built upon a fundamental misperception: that the U.S. health care system represents a "free\'a0market."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Both the Left and the Right commonly describe America's health care system as "free market," in contrast to those of the social democracies of western Europe. For the Left, this is seen as a flaw to be corrected; for the Right, it is a virtue to be preserved. For better or worse, however, the United States has not had a free-market health care system for generations.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Both single-payer and market-based systems outperform the U.S. 
\f2\b0 Contrary to perception, U.S. government entities spent far more than their European peers on health care prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. While single-payer systems like Canada's spend less than the U.S., market-oriented systems in Switzerland and Singapore are far more fiscally efficient. (Graphic: A. Roy / FREOPP; Source: OECD, WHO,\'a0FREOPP)
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For example, in 2013, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), U.S. government entities collectively spent $4,160 per capita on health care, the third-highest such total in the\'a0world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Notably, these figures represent America's standing prior to the implementation of the ACA's spending provisions in 2014. On a per-capita basis, the vast majority of universal health care systems in the industrialized world spend less taxpayer money than does that of the U.S. It is a testament to how profoundly costly American health care is, that tens of millions remain uninsured despite this extraordinary level of public spending.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On the Left, these data are used to argue that market-based health care cannot keep health care costs in check. But that is not the case. As the table above shows, Switzerland-a country with a universal system of private health insurance and no "public options"-has one of the most fiscally sustainable health care systems in the\'a0world.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Indeed, Switzerland has achieved universal coverage with 45 percent less public spending than the United States. Put another way: if America had Switzerland's health care system, the U.S. would not have a debt and deficit crisis. How did Switzerland do\'a0it?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What a market-based health care system looks\'a0like
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Before considering the Swiss model in more detail, it is important to contemplate what a market-based health care system looks\'a0like.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 No industrialized nation has a libertarian health care system in which the government plays no role in subsidizing or regulating health insurance. However, there are a number of market-based models in which private insurance plays a primary if not exclusive role, and where consumers have a meaningful amount of choice in the cost and design of the coverage they buy. The characteristics of a market-based health care system\'a0include:
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Freedom of choice. 
\f2\b0 Unlike in a single-payer system, in which the only available insurer is a government agency, market-based systems give consumers the ability to choose among a broad range of private health insurance options, so that they can find one that best suits their needs. Choice also creates the opportunity for new models of insurance to evolve, with additional benefits or features that would not have been feasible or desirable in past\'a0decades.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Consumer-driven incentives. 
\f2\b0 In a market-based system, consumers are price-sensitive: that is to say, if they consumer costlier services or coverage, they will have to cover a meaningful amount of the cost. Price sensitivity is critical, as it incentivizes insurers to deliver coverage at the lowest possible price, through innovations in care management and through efficient price negotiations with hospitals, doctors, and drug companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Access to innovation. 
\f2\b0 Because single-payer systems are frequently "free" at the point of care, governments deploying such systems ration access to new technologies. Government systems also lack the flexibility to incorporate new ideas in health care delivery. Market-based systems are more open to medical innovations that improve health, extend lives, and lower\'a0costs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Access to doctors. 
\f2\b0 Single-payer systems often suffer from a low supply of participating physicians, leading to long wait times for care. In market-based systems, patients have broad, though not necessarily unlimited, access to medical care, with low wait times and strong customer\'a0service.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Underlying cost. 
\f2\b0 If market-based systems are working well, and insurers are competing for individuals' enrollment on the basis of price and quality, the underlying cost of insurance should be affordable for the average individual before subsidies are taken into\'a0account.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Fiscal sustainability. 
\f2\b0 Health care spending throughout the industrialized world often grows at a pace that exceeds economic growth. This is particularly dangerous for heavily subsidized systems, because the growth in subsidies can exceed the ability of taxpayers to fund\'a0them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 100 million Americans are already in single-payer programs. 
\f2\b0 Contrary to claims that the U.S. is a "free market" health care system, only about 13 percent of Americans are free to choose their own coverage in something resembling a marketplace: the individual market, Medicare Advantage, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. By contrast, approximately a third of Americans are on some form of single-payer, government-run coverage. While Americans who receive coverage from their employer are privately insured, they usually have little choice in the kind of coverage they can buy. (Graphic: A. Roy / FREOPP; Sources: Congressional Budget Office, FREOPP analysis)
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So: how many Americans participate in something that can be fairly called market-based health insurance? The United States has a highly fragmented health care system. Roughly 90 percent of legal U.S. residents have health insurance, but the way in which Americans obtain coverage varies\'a0widely.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Over 100 million Americans are on single-payer, government-run health insurance, provided by the traditional Medicare program, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, or the Veterans Health Administration. Over 50 million receive coverage from market-based programs with a range of private insurance choices: Medicare Advantage, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and the individual health insurance market. Another 151 million non-federal employees receive private coverage from their employers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is worth reviewing these systems against the standard of market-based health insurance that we defined\'a0above.
\f0\fs24 \

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 While employer-based health insurance coverage is commonly thought of as America's "market based" health insurance system, it departs considerably from market principles. Employers rely on the largest and fastest-growing subsidy in the tax code-the exclusion from taxation of the value of employer-sponsored insurance (ESI)-to offer coverage to half of all Americans. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that fiscal value of this tax break in 2019-in terms of lost revenue to the federal government, and/or lower taxes elsewhere-is 1.4 percent of GDP, or roughly $300 billion. The value of the exclusion from state and local taxation represents an additional $38 billion, for a total of $338 billion. (Fiscal sustainability: C).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because ESI premiums are taken out of a worker's paycheck before he receives it, employees rarely understand how much of their compensation is taken up by the cost of health care. They demand access to costly services because they lack the tools to understand how costly services affect their health insurance premiums. (Consumer-driven incentives: D)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This lack of price sensitivity, in turn, has led the cost of employer-based coverage to explode. Indeed, American ESI is the costliest form of health insurance in the world. (Underlying cost:\'a0F)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Furthermore, workers in the ESI system rarely get to choose their health insurer; instead, that insurer is chosen on their behalf by a human resources executive at their employer. However, an increasing number of employers are deploying high deductibles and other cost-sharing tools to keep costs down; average deductibles have tripled in the last decade. As a result, more workers are gaining access to tax-advantaged Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts, which provide improved choice for routine health care expenses. (Freedom of choice:\'a0D)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In general, however, employers know that their employees are not price sensitive, and see generous health benefits as a retention tool. As a result, they have been reluctant to limit access to costly providers or health care services, out of fear that workers will rebel and decamp to a rival employer. (Access to doctors: A; Access to innovation: A)
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For all these reasons, economists have long sought to curtail the ESI tax exclusion. They have had limited\'a0success.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain campaigned on replacing the employer tax exclusion with a universal tax credit of $2,500 per individual or $5,000 per family. Despite the fact that the $2,500 individual tax credit is slightly more generous than the existing value of the tax break for employer-sponsored insurance, and would apply to all Americans, including the uninsured, then-Sen. Barack Obama spent over $100 million on a campaign ad that attacked the plan because it would "tax health benefits for the first time ever, meaning higher income taxes for millions."
\f0\fs24 \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 After Obama became President, however, his signature health reform-the Affordable Care Act-did something quite similar to McCain's proposal, applying a "Cadillac tax"-a 40 percent excise tax-to expensive employer-based plans, and using the funds to pay for tax credits for the uninsured. Indeed, the Affordable Care Act is the law that "taxed health benefits for the first time\'a0ever."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Congress has repeatedly put off the start date for the imposition of the Cadillac tax; when the ACA was passed, it was supposed to go into effect in 2018. After several amendments by Congress, the Cadillac tax is now scheduled to take effect in 2022, and applies the 40 percent tax to the value of health benefits exceeding $11,200 for individuals and $30,150 for family coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Federal Employees Health Benefits\'a0Program
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Overall grade: B-minus

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, is a form of employer-sponsored health insurance. But it deserves separate treatment from traditional ESI, because it contains some market-based features that conventional employer-based insurance lacks.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 8 million federal employees participate in FEHBP, which gives workers an average of 24 health insurance offerings (Freedom of choice: A-plus), compared with just one or two in conventional ESI. Taxpayers fund 72 percent of the weighted average premium of all plans, not to exceed 75 percent of the premium for any given plan; this amounts to nearly a $7,000 per year subsidy from taxpayers (Fiscal sustainability: C).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since federal employees do save some money if they choose a less-expensive plan, there is an element of price sensitivity to the FEHBP (Consumer-driven incentives: B), but the very generous subsidy incentivizes federal workers to choose costly plans with low deductibles and high premiums (Underlying cost: F). The generosity of these plans, and their high cost, means that federal employees have very broad access to hospitals and doctors, including high-cost providers (Access to doctors: A-plus; Access to innovation: A).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Medicare Advantage

\f2\fs20 \cf0 2019 enrollment: 22\'a0million
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Medicare Advantage, alternatively known as Medicare Part C, is the program that administers the Medicare benefit package-hospital care and outpatient physician care-through private insurers. Medicare Advantage plans commonly cover additional services, such as vision, dental, and prescription drugs. Enrollment in MA is growing at a rapid pace, because private insurers are delivering the basic Medicare benefit at a lower cost than traditional Medicare, with better health outcomes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Seniors in MA can select from 21 different plans, on average, and are expected to pay the difference if plans exceed the cost of Medicare's premium benchmark (Consumer-driven incentives: B). That provides a meaningful incentive for insurers to compete on price, though the structure of Part C limits the utility of price competition. (For a thorough discussion of this issue, please see Medicare Advantage: A Platform for Affordable Health\'a0Reform.)
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But despite those limitations, the intense competition among Medicare Advantage plans for market share is leading to a golden age of managed care innovation, deploying 21st-century 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , machine learning, artificial intelligence, wearable technologies, and novel delivery models (Access to innovation: A-plus).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 To take one example, in January 2019, CNBC reported that Apple was in talks with "at least three private Medicare plans about subsidizing the Apple Watch for people over 65 to use as a health tracker." Some of these insurers are established players, according to the report, whereas others are venture-backed startups. "Avoiding one emergency room visit would more than pay for the advice," observed Bob Sheehy, CEO of insurance startup Bright\'a0Health.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Medicare Advantage plans are highly affordable for seniors, primarily because they are extremely heavily subsidized by younger taxpayers, as all Medicare plans are (Fiscal sustainability: D).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But Medicare Advantage plans also do a far better job than other plans at negotiating payment rates with hospitals and doctors, because providers outside of MA networks are generally required to accept traditional Medicare's reimbursement rates (Underlying cost: C; Access to doctors: A). By contrast, the average employer-based plan pays nearly double what Medicare pays for hospital\'a0care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Individually-purchased health insurance

\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The market for Americans who buy health insurance on their own-as opposed to through the government or their employer-was transformed by the Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 when the ACA's novel layer of federal regulations went into effect. The best-known of those regulations requires insurers to offer coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, also known as guaranteed issue.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But the law contains a blizzard of other, less-well-known regulations, the result of which has been an explosion in the cost of individually-purchased health insurance, especially for uninsured Americans below the age of 45, those in average health or better, and those with incomes above $30,350 for childless adults and $62,750 for families of four (i.e., above 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level). In effect, the ACA subsidizes coverage for uninsured Americans who are sick by overcharging uninsured Americans who are healthy (Underlying cost: D). These high premiums are not accompanied by low deductibles; indeed, the median deductible for a benchmark Silver plan in 2019 was\'a0$4,375.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The regulatory intrusion represented by the ACA, combined with chaotic enforcement by the Obama administration, has kept many insurers out of the ACA's health insurance exchanges. In 2019, the average individual market enrollee could choose from among four insurers, and those plans had little room for variation from each other, outside of provider network design (Freedom of choice:\'a0C).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 2019 ACA exchange enrollment is 15 million short of CBO's 2010 estimates. 
\f2\b0 The Congressional Budget Office has significantly reduced its projections of enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges. However, it took eight years for the CBO to bring its projections down to where enrollment trends were headed. The above figures include both subsidized and unsubsidized participants. (Graphic: A. Roy / FREOPP; Source: Congressional Budget\'a0Office)
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Remarkably, the number of people enrolled in the individual market is roughly unchanged from prior to the ACA; in 2013, prior to the ACA taking effect, approximately 13 million people purchased coverage in the individual market. Today, 13 million people are in the individual market: 9 million on the ACA exchanges (7 million with premium subsidies); 4 million outside the exchanges; and 1 million through the Basic Health Program, a version of the ACA exchanges organized at the state\'a0level.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As the chart above illustrates, in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office projected that 24 million Americans would enroll in the exchanges in 2019; the actual figure was closer to 9\'a0million.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The news is not all bad, however. The ACA's sliding scale of subsidies, modeled after Switzerland's, allows for financial assistance for sick and low-income enrollees, while gradually phasing out up the income scale so as to mitigate the problem of "subsidy cliffs" which disincentivize low-earners from raising their income by, for example, working longer\'a0hours.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The ACA's insurance exchanges deploy the best pricing signal of any system in America: competitive bidding based on the second-least-costly Silver plan (i.e., a plan with an actuarial value of 70 percent) in a given geographic area. In 2019, for example, the average premium for the second-least-costly Silver plan was $477 per month. Enrollees who choose a different plan, costing $500 per month, would be responsible for the extra $23. Unfortunately, those who choose a plan less costly than the benchmark $477 per month do not capture the savings; however, the competitive bidding process gives insurers an incentive to propose the lowest possible price (Consumer-driven incentives: B+). This stands in contrast to Medicare Advantage, where the federal government sets the rate at which plans are paid, by relating it to what single-payer Medicare costs to cover the same\'a0patient.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Importantly, Section 1401(b)(3)(ii) of the ACA contains a fiscal "failsafe" that specifies that once ACA premium and cost-sharing subsidies exceed 0.504 percent of gross domestic product-approximately $108 billion in 2019 GDP terms-the aggregate amount of those subsidies can only grow at the same rate as the overall consumer price index. While the 0.504 percent threshold will not be breached in the near term-the Congressional Budget office projects that aggregate subsidies will remain below $100 billion through 2029-the failsafe aligns subsidy growth with consumer inflation, rather than U.S. health care inflation: a key requirement for long-term fiscal sustainability (Fiscal sustainability: A).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Individual market insurers tend to pay providers in a similar fashion to Medicare Advantage and employer-sponsored coverage, leading to reasonably broad access to care and innovative technologies (Access to doctors: A-minus; Access to innovation: A).

\f2\fs20 \cf0 2019 enrollment: 9\'a0million
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is worthwhile to compare each of the American models of private health insurance to the world's gold standard in market-based health insurance: Switzerland. While the Swiss system is not perfect, and would benefit from targeted reforms, overall it represents the best real-world model of how competitive markets can deliver universal coverage through private insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The modern Swiss health care system arose from reforms that were enacted in 1996, establishing a universal, market-based health insurance system. In Switzerland, there are no "public option" government-run insurers like Medicare or Medicaid; instead, everyone purchases private insurance on a robust individual market, with 26 regional insurance exchanges.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Consumers have a choice of plans with deductibles of 300, 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 2,500 Swiss francs, with an out-of-pocket cap of CHF 700 above the deductible; the Swiss franc is roughly equivalent to the U.S. dollar. Price transparency is straightforward, with all insurer prices easily available online. Insurers are allowed to vary premiums by age, sex, and hospitalizations in the previous year. Like Americans, the Swiss have the option to select managed care plans with narrower networks of providers, in exchange for lower premiums. Indeed, the average Swiss resident has a choice of 59 insurers (Freedom of choice:\'a0A-plus).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While health care in Switzerland is slightly costlier than in other European countries, it is far lower than it is in the United States (Underlying cost: B-plus). Switzerland, a wealthy country, spends 12 percent of GDP on health care, compared to 18 percent in the U.S. A key feature of cost control in Switzerland is that the Swiss allow insurers at the cantonal level to jointly negotiate reimbursement rates for hospital services and prescription drugs, balancing out the natural monopoly power of providers and drug companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Swiss public spending on health care is roughly half that of the U.S., because only poorer and sicker citizens receive financial assistance (Fiscal sustainability: A-minus). In the U.S., nearly everybody receives a substantial subsidy to buy health insurance, regardless of need. Indeed, in the employer-based system, the highest earners receive the largest tax subsidy, because their income tax rates are the highest, and therefore the exclusion of health insurance from taxable income is of greatest monetary value for\'a0them.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Regional flexibility in Swiss health insurance subsidies. 
\f2\b0 The Swiss health care system allows for considerable flexibility at the cantonal level; cantons are the Swiss equivalent of U.S. states. The cantonal abbreviations stand for: Z\'fcrich (ZH), Bern (BE), Luzern (LU), Uri (UR), Schwyz (SZ), Unterwalden (Obwalden (OW) / Nidwalden (NW)), Glarus (GL), Zug (ZG), Freiburg (FR), Solothurn (SO), Basel (Basel Stadt (BS)/ Basel Land (BL)), Schaffhausen (SH), Appenzell (Appenzell Ausserrhoden (AR) / Appenzell Innerrhoden (AI)), Sankt Gallen (SG), Graub\'fcnden (GR), Aargau (AG), Thurgau (TG), Ticino (TI), Vaud (VD), Valais (VS), Neuch\'e2tel (NE), Gen\'e8ve (GE), and Jura (JU). The Swiss Franc (CHF) is roughly equivalent in value to the U.S. dollar. (Source: B. Gerritzen et al. / Universitat St.\'a0Gallen)

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Switzerland subsidizes, on a sliding scale, the premiums its citizens pay for private health insurance: a system known in the U.S. as "premium support." In Switzerland, low-income individuals are fully subsidized; middle-income individuals are modestly subsidized; and upper-income individuals are not subsidized. Individual Swiss cantons, the equivalent of U.S. states, have the flexibility to alter the formula by which subsidies phase out; as the above chart demonstrates, Swiss cantons reflect a wide variety of approaches.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The sliding subsidy scale mitigates one of the key challenges with traditional welfare programs, in which recipients are no longer eligible for a defined benefit once their income exceeds a specified threshold. These "benefit cliffs" discourage welfare recipients from seeking additional work, because by increasing their wage income, they are decreasing their overall income, once the value of the rescinded welfare benefits is taken into\'a0account.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Like Americans in the private market, Swiss citizens are fully able to choose their doctor, and enjoy broad access to innovative technologies (Access to doctors: A; Access to innovation: A).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Adapting from the best real-world market-based models
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What would an ideal blend of these various private-sector health insurance systems look\'a0like?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Learn from Switzerland on reducing the cost of care.
\f2\b0  By far, the biggest problem with American health care is its cost. Cost is the reason that tens of millions of Americans are uninsured, and why tens of millions more are insured, but struggling to afford their coverage. This problem is especially acute with employer-sponsored insurance.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Swiss health insurance is about half the price of American coverage. Two key features of the Swiss system stand out in this\'a0regard:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Strong consumer-driven incentives for lower cost. Because each Swiss resident buys insurance on his or her own, and are economically rewarded for choosing lower-cost plans, health insurance in Switzerland works much like auto insurance in the U.S., in which coverage is universal, and insurers have an incentive to negotiate effectively on consumers' behalf. These features are especially absent in the employer-sponsored market, where workers need and deserve more choice. One way to expand choice in the employer market is to allow workers to use employer-funded Health Reimbursement Accounts to purchase individual-market coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tools for curtailing monopoly power.In the U.S., regional hospital monopolies and prescription drug monopolies demand high prices from insurers, who lack the negotiating leverage (and, in employer-sponsored coverage, the strong incentive) to fight back. Switzerland addresses this problem in part by allowing insurers in a given canton to jointly negotiate prices with regional hospital monopolies and drug companies. Medicare Advantage deploys an alternative mechanism: using Medicare's fee-for-service rates as a way of capping the pricing power of hospital monopolies. Medicare has proven less effective at controlling the cost of physician-administered drugs, though recent initiatives from the Trump administration may lead to progress in this\'a0regard.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Strengthen the individual market for health insurance. 
\f2\b0 While market-based features can be added to every patch of the U.S. health care system, the most important-and most sustainable-path to market-based universal coverage is to strengthen the individual market for health insurance.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The individual market increases consumer satisfaction, reduces costs, and expands innovation. In the U.S., the individual market is also the most fiscally sustainable private market, because over the long term, growth in ACA premium and cost-sharing subsidies is tied to consumer inflation. This fiscal failsafe in the ACA, in turn, gives insurers a powerful incentive to hold the line on\'a0costs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Strengthening the individual market requires important reforms-correcting the Affordable Care Act's key design flaws-so that individual-market premiums are actually affordable for more\'a0people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It also involves enlarging the individual market, so that more insurers have an incentive to participate, creating a virtuous cycle of competition, innovation, and cost reduction.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The remainder of this paper focuses on reforms that could achieve these objectives.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Drawbacks of the ACA exchanges
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Apart from the basic aim of expanding health coverage, the authors of the ACA exchanges sought to achieve several objectives by heavily regulating the individual insurance market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their first goal was consumer protection. They required that all participating insurers offer plans to anyone who sought one (guaranteed issue). They also required that plans compete on the basis of standardized financial benefits (actuarial value), so that consumers would not have to worry that a plan's fine print would leave them with unanticipated medical expenses.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their second goal was redistribution. They forbade plans from charging lower premiums to healthier individuals, and constricted the ability of plans to charge lower premiums to younger enrollees ("community rating").
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They required insurers to charge the same rates to men and women: in effect, a redistribution from men to women, because women, on average, consume more health care services. They required all plans to cover services ("essential health benefits"), such as drug addiction therapy, that few people might need: in effect, requiring all insured individuals to subsidize those services on behalf of the minority who use\'a0them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their third goal was utility conversion. They sought to convert the existing private insurers into regulated utilities, whose rates and operating margins ("medical loss ratios") would be prescribed and regulated by the federal government. The ACA authors believed that there is a fundamental conflict between the economic interests of insurers and those of patients.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unfortunately, this approach has significant drawbacks. Most importantly, the ACA significantly drives up the cost of individually purchased health insurance in most of the country. On average, premiums in the individual market have doubled since the ACA went into effect. The ACA imposes these cost increases principally on healthier and younger individuals, and on men more than on\'a0women.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A key development took place in December 2017, when President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). That law eliminated the penalty connected to the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, as of January 1, 2019, effectively repealing it. The individual mandate was one of the key flaws of the ACA-and, incidentally, the biggest flaw of the Swiss health care system. The ACA's mandate was doing little to encourage individuals to sign up for health insurance, due to its plethora of exemptions and weak enforcement by both the Obama and Trump administrations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The reason this change is significant is because it fundamentally changes the way the individual market works. Now, insurers and policymakers must work to make health insurance attractive to skeptical consumers, instead of irresponsibly driving up its cost and forcing consumers to buy it\'a0anyway.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Proposed changes to the individual health insurance market
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Preserve consumer protections. 
\f2\b0 There are a number of features that the Affordable Care Act standardized in the individual market that will and ought to be preserved. These include the consumer-friendly system of metal tiers?-?Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum?-?that allow individuals to easily compare the financial value of competing health plans. They include the "guaranteed issue" requirement that all insurers offer coverage to anyone willing to pay the necessary premium, and the "community rating" requirement that all insurers charge the same premium to individuals of the same age, regardless of health status or gender. Congress should preserve the ACA's caps on lifetime and out-of-pocket limits for Bronze plans and above so as to ensure that every American has access to the benefits of true insurance: protection from catastrophic financial loss due to illness or\'a0injury.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Integrate high risk pools through reinsurance.
\f2\b0  A number of states, including Alaska and Maine, have sought waivers from the ACA, under Section 1332 of the law, to implement reinsurance programs for the individual market. Reinsurance programs work by directly funding the cost of care for the costliest insurance market enrollees, relieving other policyholders from the burden of paying for those costs through higher premiums. Actuarial studies estimate that a federally funded reinsurance program of $20 billion per year could reduce premiums by 20 percent, reducing spending on ACA premium subsidies by as much as $15-16 billion. These funds could be administered either through a federal reinsurance program, block grants to states, or a combination of both, under which states could have the option to take the funds in a block grant form, or leave the reinsurance program to the federal government. Reinsurance should explicitly include coverage for maternity care; in this way, individual-market plans can fully fund maternity care while reducing its effect on adverse selection (because young men of the same age face higher premiums under the ACA's 1:1 gender rating). Outlays for reinsurance funds, net of savings from premium subsidies, should be offset by reduced spending elsewhere.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Reduce premiums for young people. 
\f2\b0 In dollar terms, 64-year-olds consume about six times as much health care as 19-year-olds. But the ACA forces insurers to charge their youngest enrollees no less than one-third what they charge their oldest enrollees, effectively doubling premiums for younger adults. As those younger adults drop out of the market, premiums for older adults rise, because premiums are determined by the average health care utilization by an enrollee in the plan: a concept known as adverse selection. Restoring 6:1 or 5:1 "age bands," from the ACA's 3:1 ratio, can do a lot to bring young people back into the market, reducing premiums for everyone. In addition, Congress should age-adjust the tax credits, along the lines of Section 202 of the American Health Care Act or Section 131 of the Fair Care Act. Because the ACA's subsidy system caps the percentage of income that any subsidy-eligible enrollee will spend on premiums, older, sicker, and poorer individuals remain protected against unaffordable premiums under this system. In addition, by encouraging healthier and younger individuals to purchase insurance, this approach reduces average individual premiums. An transitional measure could be added to such a reform, for individuals with incomes between 400 and 600 percent of FPL, such that these individuals would be eligible for premium assistance for costs above 11.5 percent of their income. The 600 percent FPL threshold would gradually decrease back down to 400 percent in 2030, resulting in an estimated ten-year outlay of $12\'a0billion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Consolidate the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program into the individual market. 
\f2\b0 Today, federal employees receive a substantial taxpayer-funded subsidy-nearly $7,000-to purchase health insurance coverage that is far costlier than that available to most private-sector employees. It would be highly beneficial to merge this program with the individual market, by converting the FEHBP subsidy into a 100 percent subsidy for the second-least-costly Bronze-level ACA plan in the employee's region. This reform would ultimately double the size of the individual market, strengthening its risk pool and increasing insurer participation. It would also strengthen individual market policymaking, as every employee at the Department of Health and Human Services-and every employee in Congress-would be enrolled in the individual market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Allow employer-funded HRAs to pay for individual market coverage. 
\f2\b0 In October 2018, the Trump administration proposed a new rule that would allow employer-funded Health Reimbursement Accounts to be used to purchase individual health insurance coverage. This could transform the individual market, by allowing employer to gain fiscal certainty around their annual health care spend, similar to the way defined contribution pension plans have replaced defined benefit pension plans. It would empower workers, who would have more choices in health coverage than they do with their employers. Congress could accelerate the change by requiring that all businesses incorporated after a certain year deploy the HRA-based approach in order to deduct the cost of health insurance from their corporate incomes. In addition, as discussed below, Congress should repeal the ACA's employer mandate, which will free up more people to enroll in individual market coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Replace the ACA's "catastrophic" option with Copper plans. 
\f2\b0 The ACA makes available so-called "catastrophic plans" that, in theory, should serve as low-cost, high deductible insurance options. In reality, these plans are are no more affordable than conventional Bronze or Silver plans, and rarely used, because they are not eligible for the ACA's premium subsidies. Congress should replace the ACA's catastrophic option with true catastrophic coverage, in the form of a Copper plan with an actuarial value of 50 percent. Copper plans should be exempt from the ACA's annual out-of-pocket caps, so as to maximize consumer choice. The ACA's premium subsidies should be usable to purchase Copper plans, allowing more people to find plans with a low or zero premium net of subsidies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Repeal ACA taxes that increase premiums. 
\f2\b0 The ACA contains several counterproductive tax increases whose net effect is to increase exchange premiums, and thereby, federal exchange subsidies. These include: the tax on health insurance premiums; the tax on medical devices; the tax on pharmaceutical products; the tax on flexible spending accounts; the tax on medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income; the tax on over-the-counter medicines; and the tax on early HSA withdrawals. All of these taxes should be repealed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Increase state flexibility. 
\f2\b0 As noted above, Section 1332 of the ACA gives states a modest amount of flexibility in managing their individual health insurance markets. In 2017, Sen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) proposed a bipartisan package of reforms that would fund cost-sharing reduction subsidies, establish Copper plans, and give states more flexibility to pursue Swiss-style variations to the way premium subsidies are distributed. Congress could build on this deal to ensure that states have the flexibility they need to pursue reforms that would allow for more innovation in insurance plan design and reduce regulatory burdens.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Reward consumers for purchasing less costly plans.
\f2\b0  Consumer-driven health plans are centered around the principle that patients should be in as much control of their health spending as possible, while still providing an insurance product that protects individuals from catastrophic financial loss. However, under the ACA, if a subsidy-eligible individual wants to buy a plan that is less expensive than his subsidy, the extra money goes to waste. Consumers should be able to have those savings deposited in a Health Savings Account (HSA) that can pay for out-of-pocket expenses. Rewarding consumers for choosing less costly plans gives insurers a powerful incentive to reduce the costs of\'a0care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Convert ACA cost-sharing subsidies into HSA contributions. 
\f2\b0 The Affordable Care Act includes cost-sharing subsidies to defray the costs of deductibles, co-pays, and other cost-sharing features of exchange-based plans, for individuals with incomes below 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Those with incomes between 100 and 150 percent of FPL are subsidized such that the effective actuarial value of their coverage is 94 percent. Those between 150 and 200 percent of FPL are subsidized to an effective actuarial value of 87 percent. Those between 200 and 250 percent of FPL are subsidized to an effective actuarial value of 73 percent. Under Section 1332 of the ACA, Congress should grant states the flexibility to convert these funds-on a deficit-neutral basis-into Health Savings Account subsidies. In this way, low-income families can retain the value of these subsidies if they do not need to deploy them in a given\'a0year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Auto-enroll eligible individuals. 
\f2\b0 The IRS encourages employers to auto-enroll their workers into individual retirement account programs like 401(k) plans. Auto-enrollment has had a significant impact on the success and scale of enrollment in IRA programs. Similarly, under Section 1332, Congress should allow states to automatically enroll their residents in a state-assigned default plan and default health savings account, so long as auto-enrollees have the ability to opt out of the enrolled plan if they so\'a0choose.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 Reform open enrollment; add late enrollment penalties. 
\f2\b0 An open enrollment period is the period within which individuals can enroll in insurance coverage that benefits from consumer protections such as guaranteed issue. The ACA's open enrollment period lasts for six weeks every year, going from early November to mid-December. Congress should give states the flexibility, under Section 1332, to conduct open enrollment less frequently, up to once every five years. Under this system, individuals who choose to forego coverage could do so without paying a fine; however, they could not simply enter and exit the system at will and take advantage of consumer protections such as coverage for preexisting conditions, and cross-subsidies such as community rating. In 2009, Paul Starr of Princeton University first advanced this reform as an alternative to the individual mandate. Starr proposed adapting an analogous provision from Germany, where there is no individual mandate, but where the open enrollment period takes place once every five years. "Congress," he wrote, "could give people a right to opt out of the mandate if they signed a form agreeing that they could not opt in for the following five years. In other words, instead of paying a fine, they would forego a potential benefit." Open enrollment reform has an additional attraction: it rewards the development of longer-term health insurance contracts. Insurers that know they will be managing an enrollee's care for a longer period of time have an additional incentive to engage in prevention, knowing that they are more likely to reap its rewards in the form of better long-term health. As a companion policy, Congress could introduce late enrollment penalties, modeled after those used in the Medicare program, in order to incentivize timely enrollment. The combination of less adverse selection, longer insurance contracts, and late enrollment penalties will lead to a much stronger individual insurance market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Reforming employer-based insurance
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 More Americans obtain health coverage through their employers than through any other source. According to the Congressional Budget Office, nearly half of all U.S. residents?-?159 million?-?are enrolled in employer-based coverage in\'a02019.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Americans don't expect their employers to provide them with auto insurance or life insurance. The reason that they expect health insurance from their jobs has to do with a historical accident: the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The history of employer-sponsored health\'a0coverage
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The tax exclusion is the unintended out- growth of World War II economic policy. Prior to the war, health insurance was rare: health technology was in its infancy, and most medical care still took place in patients' homes. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But in 1929, a group of teachers in Dallas?-?spurred by their increased need for hospital services?-?came together and signed an agreement with Baylor University Hospital under which the teachers would pay $6 a year in exchange for 21 days of hospitalization.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The plan grew to cover additional employee groups in Dallas; eventually, the American Hospital Association encouraged other hospitals to adopt similar plans. Hospitals liked the idea because it gave them more predictable income streams and ensured that their bills were paid; beneficiaries, meanwhile, enjoyed the advantages of insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Thus the Blue Cross system was\'a0born.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The system offered several advantages to patients as well as providers. The AHA required that Blue Cross-branded plans allow beneficiaries to freely choose their doctors and hospitals. Blue Cross plans charged sick and healthy people similar premiums (i.e., community rating). And because they were organized as nonprofit corporations, insurers enjoyed tax-exempt status and were freed from certain insurance regulations that would have required them to keep assets in reserve against potential claims.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Soon, physicians began establishing similar plans for their own services under the Blue Shield label. Both Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans served a significant number of low-income patients?-?but the secret of their success was covering large populations of healthy, employed\'a0workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As a result, the plans were able to build a large pool of clients who did not often require expensive care; the savings from these patients went toward covering the costs of those who did need frequent or expensive care. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For-profit insurers came to notice the success of Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and began to enter the health insurance market. They did not have community-rating rules, and so could attract healthier clients with lower premiums. A serious health insurance sector began to\'a0emerge.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The connection between health insurance and employment was first forged in the midst of World War II, as a result of the Economic Stabilization Act of\'a01942.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With most young American men off to war, the government was concerned that employers would rapidly raise wages to attract the shrinking labor pool, thereby contributing to inflation and other economic problems. But while the 1942 law placed significant constraints on employers' ability to raise wages, it did not restrict their ability to increase benefits. Employers took advantage of this loophole to introduce ever more generous health insurance as a fringe benefit?-?in lieu of the prohibited higher wages?-?to compete for the best\'a0workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 1943, a federal court ruling asserted that direct payments by employers to insurers did not count as taxable employee income?-?meaning that any amount of an employee's overall compensation dedicated to providing health insurance rather than direct cash wages would not be taxed. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This, of course, created an enormous financial incentive for employer-provided coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Internal Revenue Code reinforced this incentive in 1954 by explicitly exempting employer-sponsored health benefits from taxation. Employer-provided health coverage soon became a routine\'a0benefit.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Over the years, employer-sponsored insurance brought health care coverage to hundreds of millions of Americans. But the tax exemption for employer-sponsored plans also created massive problems that have endured to this day. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For one thing, employer-sponsored insurance makes many workers reluctant to leave unsatisfactory jobs for fear of losing their coverage. Those who fall ill while between jobs are burdened with the additional concern that a new insurance company might raise their premiums beyond what they can\'a0afford.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Insurers also face less competition and are less consumer-oriented, since they are at less risk of losing their customers. And, as noted above, because workers do not choose their own insurance, they are less likely to have plans that suit their\'a0needs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The ACA 'Cadillac tax' on high-value health\'a0plans
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Moreover, because employer-sponsored insurance is tax-exempt, employers have a major incentive to provide generous benefit packages. For example, a worker who pays federal and state income taxes at a combined rate of 30 percent will net $7,000 for every $10,000 his employer provides in gross salary. But the same employee will receive $10,000 in benefits for every $10,000 his employer spends on health insurance?-?a 43 percent improvement.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These generous benefits incentivize workers and employers to shift compensation away from cash wages, and into health care, even if those workers would benefit from higher wages. And by further divorcing workers from the cost and quality of the care they receive, the exclusion has encouraged hospitals and physicians to charge far higher prices in the United States than they do in other countries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As noted above, The Joint Committee on Taxation?-?Congress' in-house, non-partisan agency devoted to measuring the fiscal impact of tax-related legislation?-?has estimated that, in 2019, the federal government will subsidize employer-sponsored coverage by approximately $300 billion: the total amount of lost federal income taxes, Social Security payroll taxes, and Medicare payroll taxes that arise from the substitution of wage income with health benefits. In addition, state and local governments will lose an estimated $38 billion in 2019 tax revenue because of the employer tax exclusion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At over $300 billion a year, then, the size of the tax expenditure for employer-sponsored coverage is the largest entitlement in the tax code, and the third-largest entitlement?-?next to Medicare and Medicaid?-?overall. Another notable feature of the employer tax exclusion is that it disproportionately benefits wealthy people. Those in the highest income-tax brackets benefit the most from the fact that their health benefits are excluded from taxation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Affordable Care Act attempts to gradually roll back the employer tax exclusion, by employing a "Cadillac tax" on high-value health plans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Under the ACA, the tax was originally scheduled to go into effect in 2018; it applied a 40 percent excise tax on premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, with some adjustments and special-interest loopholes. These thresholds were set to increase in 2019 by a rate equivalent to the Consumer Price Index plus 1 percent (CPI+1%), and in 2020 and thereafter by the Consumer Price Index alone\'a0(CPI).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Congress has delayed the Cadillac tax several times. Under current law, it is set to become effective in 2022, applying a 40 percent excise tax on premiums that exceed $11,200 for single coverage and $30,150 for family coverage. Congress has also modified the tax so that businesses could count the tax as a deductible expense, thereby significantly reducing its\'a0bite.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Congress should streamline the Cadillac tax, by replacing it with a fiscally equivalent cap on the size of the employer tax exclusion, at thresholds comparable to those used in the Cadillac tax. Congress should eliminate most of the special-interest exceptions to the Cadillac tax that the ACA makes for particular labor unions, while preserving those in the new standard deduction for genuinely high-risk occupations such as law enforcement and fire protection.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Repealing the ACA's employer\'a0mandate
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The ACA also contains an employer mandate, requiring firms with 50 or more full-time workers to offer federally defined "minimum essential coverage" or pay a fine of $2,000 times the total number of full-time-equivalent employees at the firm, less\'a030.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The employer mandate represents unwise public policy, on a number of\'a0fronts.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 First, it increases the cost for businesses to hire new workers, thereby acting as a drag on economic growth by increasing unemployment and the cost of goods and services.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Second, it perpetuates the inefficient linkage between health insurance and employment. As noted above, economists across the political spectrum have long advocated transitioning away from employer-sponsored insurance toward individually owned insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Employer-sponsored coverage is costlier and less portable than individually owned coverage. Furthermore, employer-sponsored coverage is not tailored to the specific needs of individual employees but rather to the interests of the employer.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Third, the mandate has little to no impact on the number of people with health insurance, according to several non-partisan studies. An Urban Institute study published in July 2013 found "that the ACA can achieve all its major objectives without the employer mandate." A follow-on study published in May 2014 estimated that the number of Americans with health insurance in 2016 would decline by a mere 0.08 percent if the mandate were repealed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fourth, transitioning from employer-sponsored coverage to individually purchased coverage would have a minor impact on the deficit. A March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office found that if an additional 14 million workers moved from employer-based to exchange-based coverage, the deficit would actually decrease by $13 billion over ten years. This is because the increase in exchange subsidies is offset by a reduction in lost revenue from the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In July 2013, the CBO estimated that a one-year delay of the employer mandate would increase spending on the exchanges by $3 billion, increase tax revenue by $1 billion due to an increase in taxable income, and reduce tax revenue by $10 billion due to the elimination of the employer mandate\'a0fine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Fifth, the employer mandate gives firms a perverse incentive to avoid hiring low-income workers. According to the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, 97 percent of firms with 50 or more workers already offer health benefits. 97 percent is not 100 percent, of course, and not all firms offer coverage to every employee. But the ACA's employer mandate, perversely, incentivizes employers to avoid hiring low-income workers, precisely the type who tend to be uninsured.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As Robert Greenstein and Judith Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities put it in 2009: "In essence, affected firms would pay a tax for hiring people from low- or moderate-income families."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The penalties associated with the employer mandate are triggered only if a worker is not offered what the ACA deems "affordable" coverage, and if the worker then gains subsidized coverage on an ACA-sponsored insurance exchange.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The ACA thereby gives employers four incentives: (1) to hire fewer full-time workers; (2) to offer so-called unaffordable coverage, for which the penalties are lower; (3) to hire workers from high-income families, who are not eligible for subsidies; and (4) to hire illegal immigrants, who are also ineligible for subsidies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In sum, the employer mandate penalizes firms for hiring low-income Americans. Through the Affordable Care Act, these individuals are able to gain subsidized health insurance. But they are tagged with a scarlet "S"?-?for gaining those subsidies?-?because, to employers, hiring subsidized individuals will be far more costly than hiring unsubsidized ones.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lowering the cost of employer-sponsored coverage
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Affordable Care Act's impact on health insurance premiums is most greatly felt in the market for people who shop for coverage on their own: what economists call the individual or non-group market. This is because the employer-sponsored insurance market has already incorporated many of the premium-increasing features of the\'a0ACA.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For example, when employers purchase group coverage for their employees, insurers are typically required to offer coverage to everyone designated by the employer (guaranteed issue), with similar premiums regardless of health status (community rating).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 However, some insurance regulations that affect the individual insurance market also affect the employer-sponsored market, especially the small group\'a0market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Employer-sponsored insurance can be divided into three categories. The "small group" market applies to employers with an average of one to 100 total employees. The "large group" market encompasses employers with an average of more than 100 total employees.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is a third category of companies: companies that take advantage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, to self-insure. Instead of paying premiums to an insurer, which then reimburses hospitals and doctors for incurred health claims, self-insured employers pay those claims directly. These self-insured ERISA plans are exempt from state insurance regulations, though they are subject to many of the ACA's federal insurance regulations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Small group plans, in particular, are affected by the ACA's requirements regarding essential health benefits and medical loss\'a0ratios.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Hence, reforming many ACA provisions that affect the individual market also would reduce premiums in the employer-sponsored market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In addition, to make employer-based coverage more affordable, Congress and the executive branch must take steps to reform the abuses of monopoly power in the hospital and pharmaceutical industries.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But ultimately, the most important ways to make employer-sponsored coverage more affordable is to evolve away from the group model and toward a system of consumer-driven, individually purchased health insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Trade is a cornerstone of the modern world.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Of all the achievements that mankind has managed since the Second World War, a world in which free trade is the norm must surely rank as one of the greatest civilisational achievements.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Getting more than 200 sovereign states, each with their own political constituencies to allow their citizens to trade freely (relatively) with each other is no mean feat.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 While we have a lot to celebrate, there's still a long way to go.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tariffs are much lower on average than they have ever been and in economic faculties the benefits of free trade are generally acknowledged by academics who lean either left or right on the political spectrum.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unfortunately, the mercantilist thinking of old persists among politicians.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is evidenced by the kind of action that South Africa's trade and industry department often engages in, i.e. namely protectionist import tariffs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The trade and industry department submitted a presentation to Parliament in March 2017 claiming that "trade measures" were required to protect the domestic chicken industry.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The justification for this apparently included the protection of jobs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This kind of thinking ignores the fact that consumers are better off when they can buy products more cheaply, leaving their extra disposable income to go into other areas of the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As of March 2019, the South African Revenue Service had 71 listed anti-dumping tariffs, ranging from 3.86% on frozen chicken supplied by three Dutch companies to 113.25% for "stranded wire of iron and steel" produced by Chinese companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 By doing this, to protect uncompetitive domestic industries, the government intentionally raises the price that South Africans must pay for the goods they consume.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The World Trade Organisation has done a lot in getting us to the point where global trade is the freest it has ever been, but the same organisation also encourages certain negative tendencies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The best example of which is dumping. The World Trade Organisation allows countries to charge anti-dumping duties to protect a domestic industry or facilitate the creation of one if it doesn't exist.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is backward thinking. The point of trade is that no-one can produce everything they need.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Imagine government deciding to punish Shoprite for offering products more cheaply in the townships than it does in more developed suburbs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That would seem nonsensical yet that is exactly the idea behind anti-dumping measures.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Companies are punished for offering products more cheaply in foreign - usually underdeveloped - markets than they do in their domestic (usually developed) market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some warped logic is going on here and it exemplifies the insanity of crony capitalism. As we saw in the case of South African and Brazilian chicken, the people who were most vocal in arguing for anti-dumping measures were representatives of domestic chicken companies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Interestingly, the trade and industry department presentation to Parliament notes that the domestic chicken industry struggles to compete internationally because of factors like: increase in the cost of feedstock, increase in the price of electricity, and increase in the price of labour.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The latter two problems are caused by government through its electricity monopoly and labour laws.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Poor consumers who rely on cheap chicken as their main source of protein are being sacrificed at the altar of big chicken companies and big unions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They just do not have the financial and organisational muscle to conduct a lobbying campaign.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For some bizarre reason, international trade is seen as a domain in which the normal laws of economics do not apply.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is not the case. It's just that politicians often choose to insert themselves in-between goods and services freely flowing across a border (utilising the powers conferred by the sovereign status of their respective states).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The reality is that international trade involves the same transactions that occur within a country. Why should these transactions be subject to extra restrictions?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To end with, I would like to highlight another instance of trade restriction that benefits only the big trade unions: restrictions on the movement of labour across borders.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In South Africa, this takes the form of a work visa but the effect is the same as any tariff.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This artificial constraint on the supply of labour leads to an artificial increase not only in wages but also the price of the goods and services that that labour produces.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Restricting the free flow of trade can only make everyone worse off. History shows this to be an uncontestable truth.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In South Africa it is well known that women suffer the brunt of our many socio-economic issues. This is largely how females are viewed across South African culture, rather than as a matter of law. According to the Economic Freedom of the World index, South Africa scores 1.0, the highest possible score, according to the gender adjustment variable.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This variable measures the extent to which women are treated relative to men under the law.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Not surprisingly, the bulk of countries that score poorly are in the Middle East. South Africa has full constitutionally-enshrined equality between men and women. A good thing too, since this is the second most important variable after low inflation for those countries that want to boost their economic growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The last point comes from a regression analysis done of all 43 Economic Freedom of the World variables in order to ascertain the impact on GDP per capita growth in a year. It was found that the difference between the most gender unequal countries and the most equal could be as much as 0.48 percentage points in terms of GDP per capita growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is hardly surprising. Putting up arbitrary restrictions on half of your economically active population is not a good idea. Arab countries that restrict women's rights to work and trade are learning this lesson the hard way.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In South Africa, official government policy may not discriminate against women and that should continue being the case. But we still have a problem with how women are viewed socially. This is not really a matter for government policy, but families in particular should strive to free girls and women from the burdens of patriarchal expectations. Girls can do anything they put their minds to, just like boys can.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is harder to measure the impact of culture on aggregate economic variables like GDP, but the same logic that explains the impact of oppressive (against women) laws on the economy, should still hold when discussing oppressive cultures. It is simply not a good idea to stop someone participating in the economy based on something other than that individual's competence, which is something only a free market can determine.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Freedom is the birthright of us all, no matter what gender we belong to. Virtually every country on Earth has a history of sexist economic restrictions. Only in the past century did this change, and we can only guess at the extent to which the global economy has been stunted by this short-sightedness.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa also needs to deal with threats to the human rights of women, like male primogeniture under customary law. This is the practice by which female heirs are overlooked in favour of their male siblings or other male relatives. This cultural practice has undoubtedly had a negative effect on South Africa's economy despite our gender-neutral written laws.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Male primogeniture is a way of depriving women of their property rights. This becomes a particularly serious problem in areas where land is communally owned, where the traditional authority has effective control over who gets to use the land.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If South Africans are serious about solving the dire poverty problem we have, getting to the point where women have de facto as well as de jure equality with men is a critical part of doing that. No country can overcome the magnitude of what South Africa and the rest of Africa need to deal with while tying one of its hands behind its back. Free women and free the economy, otherwise development and progress will remain a pipe-dream.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The key to understanding inflation is to first understand the nature of money.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The common perception of money among members of the public, and even some economists, verges on the fantastical.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is seen as a means to achieve many ends that, normally, would lie beyond reach according to the rules of scarcity and exchange which are the foundation of economics.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So, what is it really?
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is important to remind ourselves that, before the advent of money, humans exchanged goods and services on the basis of the barter system.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Someone would produce more goat cheese than they needed and exchange the excess for grain, which they also needed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This system obviously has problems if it is not easy for the person who has the goat cheese to reach the person with the excess grain.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And what happens if the grain producer does not want any cheese? If the producers of goat cheese or the suppliers of grain are reachable only through a sequence of transactions, that would add unnecessary costs for the person wanting cheese or grain.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To have one good that can denominate all others - for example gold - therefore, makes it all so much easier.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The person who has excess goat cheese could then simply exchange the cheese for a quantity of gold, from this they could then deduct the quantity of gold that represents the amount of grain they want and exchange this with the grain supplier.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Money is a good like any other, but it has the special property that it is convenient to exchange quantities of it for any other good in an economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The next question to ask then is what happens when the supply of a good exceeds demand for it?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The answer is that prices have to fall to accommodate the excess supply and encourage customers to buy. Prices in this case indicate how the product is valued by actors in the market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Prices indicate relative quantities of goods or services. Therefore, when money prices for a good fall, it indicates that for the good in question less money is required to attain it than was previously the case.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 How then, do we measure the price of money?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since prices are relative, we can measure the price of money relative to other goods in the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When the price of money falls relative to one good, it means more money is required in exchange for the good than was previously the case.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Inflation, roughly speaking, means that the price of money has fallen relative to all/most other goods and services, in other words money prices have gone up in general across the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Prices, not just money prices, reflect supply and demand. Both of these things (supply and demand) depend on natural scarcity as well as individual preferences.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Therefore, whenever a central authority decides to take control of the entire money supply and make decisions on its own about the appropriate quantity of money, the risk of incorrect signals about scarcity, supply and demand for all other goods spreading throughout the economy is heightened.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Further, when this entity decides to arbitrarily select the good to use as money so as to minimise the costs of reproducing it while artificially increasing its value through force, then everyone else's hard-won production is subject to the whims of this entity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is why inflation is possibly the most serious economic risk not just in South Africa but the world over.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The South African Reserve Bank has the power to steal all rand-denominated goods and services by simply increasing the quantity of money.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That explains why I have found the most recent CPI (price inflation) figure to be the most important variable in predicting the real GDP per capita growth rate for the following year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I discovered this when analysing all the Economic Freedom of the World variables and their impact on GDP per capita.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each 5 percentage decrease in the CPI is likely to add as much as 0.87 percentage points to the coming year's GDP per capita growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Keeping in mind that GDP per capita is a better measure of national income since it accounts for differences in population among countries, the Economic Freedom of the World's "Inflation: Most recent year" variable was found to be the single most important one out of all 43 component variables in the Economic Freedom of the World report.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This should not surprise anyone, after all, inflation plays a pivotal role in capital formation (a necessary precursor to economic growth) since the latter cannot happen without savings and it would be foolish to save when money is losing value faster than investments or saving are gaining value.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 High inflation drives consumption instead of savings. This means that wealth creation is discouraged, meaning less of it will occur.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa, based on the December 2018 CPI figure of 4.5%, would get 9.1 (0 is the highest inflation and 10 is the lowest inflation) for this variable and a ranking of 114th out of 162 countries in the index.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Economist Dawie Roodt has suggested a 2% inflation cap which would put us in the 84th position.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ireland was the best ranked country in the last Economic Freedom of the World in terms of this variable and they had a GDP per capita growth rate of 6.50% in 2017.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is of critical importance to maintain the independence of the Reserve Bank while intensifying efforts to preserve the value of the rand.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is the only way South Africans can build wealth and get themselves out of poverty.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The people of Africa have been subjected to multiple injustices, slights, and violence. The list of things inflicted on Africans is endless and has no modern equivalent, except for Asia in geographical terms and the Jews in ethnic terms. These multiple injustices have been inflicted by both outsiders and Africans themselves against one another.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What happens when people are repeatedly, consistently brutalised based on their race? Their history marginalised and cast away as nothing? What happens to the individuals who have to build themselves up from these ashes? I would submit that there will be quite a bit of self-doubt. You would expect that the self-esteem of these people will be lower than ordinary.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Indeed, that is exactly what one sees in Africa. Entire nations are affected by this lack of self-esteem. There's a knee-jerk response of not taking responsibility for our own actions. Politicians exploit these tendencies to get away with the most horrendous crimes because they are black like us; and therefore, can't harm us, you see?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Africans needs to realise the nature of the world they live in. No one in the world is walking around thinking about how to give us back our sense of self. No one really cares, and nor should they, since they are busy dealing with the problems that are immediate to them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We need to understand that no one has to take Africa seriously because we are an economic nonentity. Even as the rest of the world discovers and uses the ideas that are necessary for a prosperous society, poor, low self-esteem Africans are busy pursuing socialism because their politicians tell them that to be black means to give power to politicians. That is what socialism is: It appropriates to the state (politicians) what rightfully belongs to private individuals. Nationalisation and expropriation serve that purpose.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This sickness is nothing more than a manifestation of our own insecurities. Understandable as this inferiority complex is, we have to find the strength to get rid of it. No one is coming to save us, and the rest of the world is leaving us behind.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In a sense, modern Africans are perpetuating the very worst of colonialism. By this I mean the idea that black Africans are inferior because they do not create anything of value. We now know this to be untrue historically, but ancient Africans did not have to deal with an inferiority complex. We are proving the worst racists to be correct by failing to trust each individual to take charge of their own destiny and instead entrusting it to government.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Another manifestation of these negative psychological tendencies is the hate we have for each other. In South Africa, we see this in the xenophobic attacks against dark-skinned people from other parts of Africa. In Nigeria, the President just signed an order that no foreigners will be allowed to do a job that a Nigerian can do.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is strange that most African leaders preach Pan-Africanism but practice protectionism within Africa. Europeans, on the other hand, don't have a strong philosophical concept of Pan-Europeanism, but they nonetheless trade freely with one another and trust their people to act as individuals in a relatively free market. Is there something wrong with us when our words can't even match our actions in something as simple as opening up borders?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The solutions to Africa's problems will not come from a class of leaders sitting above everyone else and being driven around in German cars. It will be solved by each and every African being allowed to define their own destiny. It will take, simply, private property rights and free markets: The only thing that has ever created anything close to the prosperous country of Wakanda in the Marvel movie Black Panther.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To do these things, we need Africans who have a sense of self-confidence. Who trust in themselves to create and produce without having to rely on the group to hide their mediocrity. Africans who believe they are the equal of anyone in the world (and maybe a little better) and can trade, play, and debate with anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Experiments with collectivism are destroying the hope of a new generation of Africans. These range from socialism, nationalism, ethnic tribalism, etc. In none of them do you find the African individual; all you find is a group of our very worst people making decisions for everyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The people of this continent need their own enlightenment. Not an import of what Europeans did necessarily, but to start thinking and recognising that the individual is always the basic unit of society. Individuals can only express what is best within them if they are given the maximum freedom to pursue whatever their version of happiness is. This also means every other individual has exactly the same freedom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Freedom belongs to every individual. Limiting it on the basis of nationality, race, ethnicity, etc. always destroys everyone else's freedom. This is because every limit equates to more power given to government. It means politicians can do more against certain individuals and everyone else can do less with and for the same individuals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I am tired of a poor and dejected Africa. I am tired of emotional rhetoric that gets us nowhere. I want to be part of the generation that gets to the promised land. For that to happen, it will take hard work but most importantly it will take freeing the potential of the magnificent people living on this continent; whatever their tribe, race, religion, gender, or sexuality is.

\f2\fs20 To do these things, we need Africans who have a sense of self-confidence. Who trust in themselves to create and produce without having to rely on the group to hide their mediocrity. Africans who believe they are the equal of anyone in the world (and maybe a little better) and can trade, play, and debate with anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Experiments with collectivism are destroying the hope of a new generation of Africans. These range from socialism, nationalism, ethnic tribalism, etc. In none of them do you find the African individual; all you find is a group of our very worst people making decisions for everyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The people of this continent need their own enlightenment. Not an import of what Europeans did necessarily, but to start thinking and recognizing that the individual is always the basic unit of society. Individuals can only express what is best within them if they are given the maximum freedom to pursue whatever their version of happiness is. This also means every other individual has exactly the same freedom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Freedom belongs to every individual. Limiting it on the basis of nationality, race, ethnicity, etc. always destroys everyone else's freedom. This is because every limit equates to more power given to the government. It means politicians can do more against certain individuals and everyone else can do less with and for the same individuals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I am tired of a poor and dejected Africa. I am tired of emotional rhetoric that gets us nowhere. I want to be part of the generation that gets to the promised land. For that to happen, it will take hard work but most importantly it will take freeing the potential of the magnificent people living on this continent; whatever their tribe, race, religion, gender, or sexuality is.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Medicare plans run by private insurers have lower premiums, broader benefits, and better health outcomes.Introduction
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb60\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For years, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D., Vt.) has campaigned for what he calls "Medicare for All"?-?a proposal that would abolish private insurers and replace them with a "federally administered single-payer health care program" that would cover all forms of health care with "no more copays, no more deductibles," and no premiums aside from substantially higher taxes. The irony of Sen. Sanders' proposal is that it looks nothing like the actual Medicare program that seniors use\'a0today.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Indeed, the part of Medicare that is working best is Medicare Advantage, which deploys private insurers to provide high-quality, low-cost coverage to\'a0seniors.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Sen. Sanders' plan would abolish Medicare Advantage, disrupting coverage for 22 million retirees. The best way to reform Medicare-and to provide affordable health care to every American-is to go in the opposite direction: to enact reforms that will further improve the quality and affordability of Medicare Advantage plans, and to learn from Medicare Advantage to improve the coverage that younger Americans can\'a0obtain.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Enrollment in single-payer Medicare is declining, while enrollment in privately-insured Medicare plans is rapidly growing.
\f2\b0  Over the last ten years, enrollment in Medicare Advantage and other privately-insured Medicare plans has doubled, from 10.5 million to 22.4 million. Over the same period, enrollment in the traditional, fee-for-service, single-payer version of Medicare has stagnated. Indeed, enrollment in single-payer Medicare has declined since 2017. (Graphic: A. Roy / FREOPP; Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Medicare's trust fund will be insolvent by\'a02026
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 60 million Americans over the age of 65 rely on Medicare for their health insurance coverage. Ensuring that seniors can continue to rely on that coverage is an essential goal of American health care\'a0policy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But what sounds simple in theory is difficult in reality. Over the next decade, federal spending on Medicare is set to double, from $672 billion in 2016 to $1.4 trillion in 2026. The Medicare Trustees project that the trust fund for Medicare's hospital insurance program, Medicare Part A, will become insolvent in 2026: three years earlier than they had previously believed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Arguably more important is Medicare's central role in driving America's rising federal debt; put simply, Medicare's current structure threatens the affordability of health care for future generations. As the baby boomers retire, the program continues to accumulate deficits at an alarming\'a0pace.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Robert Reischauer, a Democratic Medicare trustee and former CBO director, has warned against fiscal complacency, because it will only make the problem worse: "The sooner that lawmakers act, the broader will be the array of policy options that they can consider, and the greater the opportunity will be to craft solutions that are both balanced and equitable."
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be insolvent in 2026. 
\f2\b0 The Medicare Trustees' estimates of the solvency of Medicare's hospital insurance (Part A) trust fund have varied over time. In its 2018 report (red line with triangles), the Trustees project that Part A will become insolvent in 2026. Without legislative changes by Congress, at that point there will be no funds to pay for seniors' hospital expenses within the Medicare program. (Source: Congressional Research\'a0Service)Medicare's outdated\'a0design
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In most other industrialized countries, state-funded health insurance began with the poor, and was gradually extended up the income ladder. But in mid-twentieth-century America, there was still a significant stigma attached to being "on the dole," and income tests were considered demeaning.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Policymakers who sought an expanded role for government in health care thus believed that starting with the elderly would be more politically palatable. After all, the elderly were a far more sympathetic group in the public's eyes: older Americans had less opportunity to earn their own money to fund their health care, and were therefore generally poorer than other Americans (along with being less healthy).
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Being both relatively poor and relatively unhealthy, they were, in turn, less likely to have health insurance. And policymakers believed that the model of Social Security as a "self-financed" program for the elderly, paid for with a dedicated payroll tax, could easily be extended to health insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But by creating a universal, single-payer health care program for every American over 65, regardless of financial or medical need, the drafters of Medicare made the program resistant to\'a0reform.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Medicare policy\'a0trap
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Princeton sociologist Paul Starr describes this feature of Medicare as a "policy trap." In Starr's 2011 book, Remedy and Reaction, he observes:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When America finally adopted critical tax and health-financing policies in the two decades after World War II, it ensnared itself in a policy trap, devising an increasingly costly and complicated system that has satisfied enough of the public and so enriched the health care industry as to make change extraordinarily difficult. Escaping from that policy trap has become a politically treacherous national imperative.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Today, Medicare's finances are on autopilot. In contrast to most government programs, which are funded by explicit congressional appropriations, Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for guaranteed health benefits, regardless of their\'a0cost.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And the illusion of pre-funded benefits?-?the notion that Americans pay into the system while they work and then merely withdraw the funds they put in when they retire?-?no longer bears any relation to\'a0reality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to calculations published in 2013 by Eugene Steuerle and Caleb Quakenbush of the Urban Institute, the average two-earner married couple retiring in 2010 had paid $89,000 in Medicare taxes while working, but will receive $385,000 in inflation-adjusted benefits during retirement: a ratio of 4.3 to 1. A similar couple retiring in 2030 will have paid $131,000 in taxes and will receive $638,000 in inflation-adjusted benefits: a ratio of 4.9 to\'a01.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Medicare has become a massive?-?and growing?-?transfer of resources from younger workers to older retirees. And since the elderly are no longer the poorest Americans?-?on the contrary, Americans over the age of 65 are now significantly wealthier than younger Americans?-?Medicare is largely a transfer of resources from poorer to wealthier individuals.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Reforming Medicare with public\'a0support
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It has always been challenging to reconcile two principal goals of Medicare policy: maintaining the reliability of Medicare for those on it today, while ensuring that health care and coverage remain affordable for every generation to\'a0come.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There is, however, good news on this front. Advances in the management of health care, deploying innovations in 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , have dramatically improved the quality and cost-effectiveness of Medicare Advantage plans sponsored by private insurers. There are ways to make Medicare Advantage plans even less expensive, with even better outcomes?-?all while preserving Medicare's traditional set of covered benefits.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In other words, the path to politically and fiscally sustainable Medicare reform does not involve increasing seniors' premiums or reducing the scope of Medicare's benefits. Instead, it involves reducing the underlying cost of delivering Medicare coverage, by enacting reforms that reward insurers, hospitals, and doctors for competing on quality and\'a0price.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Sen. Sanders' approach, by contrast, would require extreme increases in taxation. His plan would increase federal spending by between $28 and $44 trillion over the next ten years. By comparison, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that total federal tax revenue-on individuals of all incomes-over the next decade will total $35 trillion. In other words, taxes on everyone would have to double to pay for Sen. Sanders'\'a0plan.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is true, however, that we spend too much money subsidizing health coverage for the wealthy in America. Why is it that middle-class Americans are forced to pay taxes so that retirees worth $100 million can get government-subsidized health\'a0care?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Medicare's kludgeocracy
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Johns Hopkins political scientist Steven Teles has observed a growing phenomenon in American public policy that he calls the "kludgeocracy." Citing the Oxford English Dictionary, he explains that "a 'kludge' is 'an ill-assorted collection of parts assembled to fulfill a particular purpose'...To see policy kludges in action, one need look no further than the mind-numbing complexity of the [American] health care\'a0system."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While kludgeocracy does certainly describe the U.S. health care system as a whole, the Medicare program is a particularly notable manifestation of one. Its four separate programs?-?Part A for hospital insurance, Part B for physician services, Part C for privately managed benefits, and Part D for prescription drugs?-?are profoundly inefficient, requiring most seniors to receive uncoordinated and costly care that can lead to suboptimal health outcomes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Medicare kludgeocracy has resulted in Medicare costs that far exceed those of coverage expansions in other countries. Amy Finkelstein of MIT has shown that Medicare's impact on increased hospital spending is over six times greater than what a normal expansion of health insurance would have been expected to\'a0yield.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For all its spending?-?$808 billion in 2019?-?Medicare does not provide catastrophic coverage against long-term hospitalizations. In 2019, Medicare's Part A hospital insurance covers the first 60 days of a hospitalization, with a $1,364 deductible. The next 30 days include a coinsurance fee of $341 per day in charges for hospital stays of 61-90 days, $682 per day for hospital stays longer than 90 days, and all costs beyond a total of 60 days in the hospital beyond the 90-day stay limit. Hence, while Medicare pays for many services, seniors are still liable for catastrophic costs above those covered by Part\'a0A.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And Medicare Part B, which insures against the costs of outpatient physician care?-?does, in fact, charge premiums, co-pays, and deductibles. In 2019, Medicare B's annual premium is between $1,626 and $5,526; the premium increases for those with higher\'a0incomes.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Spending on Medicare will double over the next decade.
\f2\b0  As inflation for health care products and services continues to rise faster than U.S. economic growth, federal spending on all public programs will squeeze out other important priorities like national defense and anti-poverty programs. From 2016 to 2026, federal spending on Medicare will increase from $672 billion to $1.4 trillion; combined spending on single-payer programs like Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and health care for veterans and active-duty military will rise from $691 billion to $1.2 trillion over the same period. (Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services)The emerging superiority of Medicare Advantage
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There is, however, a program within Medicare that commonly offers seniors comprehensive coverage at an attractive price: Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Part C, under which seniors choose private insurance plans to deliver Medicare-sponsored services. Medicare Advantage's premiums are often lower, despite the fact that the federal government pays insurers the same amount for Medicare Advantage that it pays for traditional, single-payer Medicare Part A and B coverage. Indeed, often for the same cost as single-payer Medicare or less, Medicare Advantage plans frequently offer supplemental benefits that traditional Medicare doesn't cover, such as prescription drugs, vision, dental, assisted living, and nursing home\'a0care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because Medicare Advantage delivers broader benefits than single-payer Medicare, sometimes with lower premiums, the program has become increasingly popular with seniors. Over the last decade, enrollment in Medicare Advantage and other private Medicare plans has doubled, from 10.5 million to 22.4 million, whereas enrollment in single-payer Medicare has stagnated. Indeed, over the last two years, enrollment in single-payer Medicare has actually declined, from 38.8 million in 2017 to 38.2 million in\'a02019.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Today, Medicare Advantage and other private plans represent 37 percent of all Medicare enrollees. More than half of newly-eligible Medicare enrollees are opting for these private plans over single-payer Medicare. Competition is robust: in 2019, there were 2,734 Medicare Advantage plans offered nationwide, up from 2,001 in\'a02016.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And the benefits of Medicare Advantage for seniors are not merely in the form of low premiums and added benefits. MA plans also deliver superior health outcomes. A July 2018 study by Avalere Health found that enrollees in Medicare Advantage with chronic conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure had 29 percent fewer avoidable hospitalizations, 42 percent fewer avoidable acute hospitalizations, 23 percent fewer inpatient stays, and 33 percent fewer emergency room visits, relative to enrollees in single-payer Medicare. "MA beneficiaries received more preventive physician tests and services," the Avalere authors noted, leading to "significantly better" health outcomes and cost\'a0savings.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Avalere study is not the only one to find that Medicare Advantage is better across an array of dimensions. Given the clear superiority of Medicare Advantage on premiums, benefits, integration, and outcomes, the important question to ask isn't why enrollment in Medicare Advantage is increasing, but why enrollment in Medicare Advantage is not increasing even\'a0faster.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Reforming the government's single-payer nudge
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A key reason is that the federal government steers seniors to enroll in single-payer Medicare, even though Medicare Advantage is the superior program. Seniors who receive Social Security benefits, but have failed to enroll in Medicare on their own, are automatically enrolled in Parts A and\'a0B.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "At present," observed Harvard's Joseph Newhouse and Thomas McGuire in a 2014 article for the Milbank Quarterly, "if a beneficiary makes no choice when becoming eligible for Medicare, he or she is, by default, assigned to [single-payer Medicare]. This default could be changed to move some or all of the nonchoosers into\'a0MA."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Congress could enact such a change quite simply. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation could also create a demonstration project that tests how default enrollment in Medicare Advantage affects premiums, benefits, and outcomes, relative to the status quo ante. In either case, seniors would be free to enroll in traditional, single-payer Medicare if they\'a0wished.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is one group of seniors who have good reason to prefer single-payer Medicare: the wealthy. Single-payer Medicare, in the form of Medicare Parts A and B, operate under any willing provider rules; any hospital or physician who contracts with the Medicare program is required to accept Medicare's government-determined fee-for-service reimbursement rates. By contrast, Medicare Advantage plans deploy provider networks which exclude high-priced facilities in order to reduce costs while preserving quality. Wealthy seniors; i.e., those who can afford single-payer Medicare premiums, have a reason to prefer the broader networks in Parts A and\'a0B.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But for nearly everyone else, there is a clear advantage to enrolling in Medicare Advantage. In 2019, 45 percent of offered plans charged premiums equal to or lower than those of single-payer Medicare; 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had the ability to choose a Medicare Advantage plan with no additional premium and the added benefit of prescription drug coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Helping seniors reduce their Medicare premium\'a0costs
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Surprisingly, few seniors choose Medicare Advantage plans whose premiums are lower than single-payer Medicare's, even though they have a theoretical financial incentive to do so. Indeed, the Newhouse-McGuire study finds that "hardly any [seniors] are enrolled in plans that charge a negative premium." Why? "Beneficiaries who join [negative premium] plans simply have less deducted from their Social Security checks for the Part B premium. This is likely less visible, or salient, to beneficiaries than is having to write a check for the premium."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because Medicare premiums are deducted from an enrollee's Social Security account, lower premiums aren't very notiecable. If seniors received a cash refund, instead of a smaller Social Security deduction, they may be more interested in choosing negative-premium MA plans. Congress or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) could enact such a\'a0change.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 CMS could make default enrollment in MA even more advantageous by only enrolling seniors by default in MA plans whose premiums were at most equal to those of single-payer Medicare.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A complementary way to achieve the same result would be competitive bidding in Medicare Advantage. Today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contract with private insurers to administer Medicare Advantage plans; CMS calculates a "benchmark" for each county based on what single-payer Medicare costs there. MA plans that are able to manage care at a lower cost than the "benchmark" are able to pocket the difference.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lowering Medicare Advantage premiums through price competition
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A different approach to benchmarking could both reduce premiums for seniors, and reduce taxpayer costs for MA: competitive bidding.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Competitive bidding for Medicare coverage was first proposed in 2009 by Roger Feldman and Bryan Dowd of the University of Minnesota, and Robert Coulam of Simmons College, in their book Bring Market Prices to Medicare: Essential Reform at a Time of Fiscal\'a0Crisis.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "The federal contribution to premiums," they write, "would be set to equal the lowest bid in each market area. This competitive pricing system would penalize plans that bid too high-their beneficiaries would pay higher premiums-providing an incentive for plans to offer their best prices. Meanwhile, low-bidding plans would be rewarded with increased enrollment."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their idea, which has been endorsed and refined by health economists from across the ideological spectrum, was to give single-payer Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans the opportunity to bid for the government's business in every region of the\'a0country.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Significantly, in 2011, Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) put forth a proposal to introduce competitive bidding for individuals who are 55 or younger; i.e., at least 10 years away from enrolling in Medicare.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A new version of the concept involves enabling seniors to choose between three versions of the Medicare benefit: (1) the traditional single-payer version; (2) the basic Medicare benefit component of Medicare Advantage; and (3) Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), under which hospitals and outpatient physician clinics collaborate to manage\'a0care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Reforming the role of Accountable Care Organizations
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While ACOs in theory allow for more coordinated health care between hospitals and physicians, in practice they can led to higher health care prices, as hospitals take advantage of the ACO structure to increase their monopoly power. Physician-led ACOs, on the other hand, provide avenues for innovation and lower\'a0costs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A study of 2.7 million patients by researchers at Harvard Medical School, led by Michael McWilliams and Michael Chernew found that "participation in shared-savings contracts by physician groups was associated with savings for Medicare that grew over the study period [2009-2015], whereas hospital-integrated ACOs did not produce savings (on average) during the same period." Indeed, hospital-led ACOs increased Medicare spending by $111 million, whereas physician-led ACOs decreased Medicare spending by $256 million. Hence, including ACOs in a competitive bidding system would only be useful if the program were reformed to focus on physician-led ACOs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Modernizing coverage for dual enrollees in Medicare and\'a0Medicaid
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 One of the most challenging aspects of the Medicare program is how it deals with nearly 11 million low-income seniors who are also enrolled in Medicaid. Because these individuals gain health coverage from two very different government programs, with overlapping benefits and differing physician networks, care for these vulnerable individuals is often of poor quality and excessive cost. Dual-eligibles often need both acute-care coverage (for conventional health care expenses, like heart attacks and stroke) and long-term care coverage (for activities of daily living, such as getting dressed in the morning or going to the bathroom), leading to even more fragmentation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dual-eligible enrollees consume more than $200 billion a year in Medicare spending, and more than $130 billion a year in Medicaid spending: approximately one-quarter of spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. On average, in 2013, spending on dual-eligibles cost $29,238, compared to $8,593 for conventional Medicare beneficiaries: a ratio of 3.4 to\'a01.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While some of this disparity can be explained by poor health status-dual-eligibles are three times as likely to be disabled as regular Medicare enrollees-much of it is driven by wasteful utilization, driven by both innocent mistakes and intentional arbitrage by some health care providers. Clay Spence and Joe Lonsdale of the Cicero Institute estimate that improved management of these patients could lead to better health outcomes and savings of over $50 billion per\'a0year:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Kenneth Thorpe has estimated that moving dual eligibles into coordinated care programs would save $10-20B a year because "well managed team based care results in lower rates of emergency room, clinic and hospital days." Based on the early results from MMP and FIDE-SNP programs as well as our diligence on private sector companies caring for expensive, complex populations, we think this figure could easily be $50B per year or\'a0more.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) noted in its June 2018 report to Congress, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) has sponsored a number of promising pilot projects that seek to integrate coverage for dual-eligibles through specialized managed care plans. Early returns indicate that these programs are succeeding at reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, mortality, and nursing home\'a0use.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to MedPAC, however, these demonstration projects, while promising, have been hampered by several limitations, including:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unstable enrollment. Dual-eligibles have been able to enroll and disenroll from integrated plans and revert to traditional, fragmented care on a nearly unlimited basis. Of the 855,000 beneficiaries in Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs) observed by MedPAC, 41 percent opted out after being passively enrolled. This has made it difficult for plans to realize savings from better-managed care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Provider manipulation of enrollees. MedPAC reported that "many beneficiaries declined to participate because they...were encouraged to opt out by providers." Providers stand to benefit from poorly managed care that leads to overutilization of unnecessary services. Hence, providers appear to be succeeding at discouraging dual-eligibles from integrated plans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Disinterest at the state level. Because savings from better-managed care flow mostly to the federal government, and states manage their own Medicaid programs, states have had little incentive to reduce wasteful utilization among dual-eligible enrolles.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At this point, we know enough about managing complex patients that Congress should empower CMS and CMMI to move forward with truly integrated management of dual-eligibles, through specialized Medicare Advantage plans. The key features of such plans would\'a0include:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Specialized, fully integrated Medicare Advantage plans. Managing dual-eligibles with complex health problems including acute care, psychiatric disorders, and disability requires specialized, focused competency, along with the economic incentives to optimize\'a0care.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Integrated, pre-structured contracts. Plans that contract separately with Medicare and a state Medicaid program have difficulty coordinating coverage. Integrated, or "three-way," contracts do better. Spence and Lonsdale suggest that such contract negotiations could be improved by enabling Medicare and Medicaid to agree on their "financial responsibilities before deciding which services to cover," as this would "greatly simplify the planning process, saving time and\'a0money."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Long-term enrollment contracts. These specialized Medicare Advantage plans will have much greater incentive to engage in preventive care and care management if they can reap the savings in lower health care utilization later on. This requires long-term contracts between the insurer and the patient. CMS should authorize specialized plans for dual-eligibles to sign long-term contracts, for as long as five years, in exchange for additional shared savings with federal and state governments.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mandatory enrollment in integrated plans. As noted above, providers actively discourage dual-eligibles in enrolling in integrated plans, because providers benefit from wasteful utilization. Seniors, on the other hand, benefit in terms of better care management, but not in terms of out-of-pocket costs (because there aren't any). Congress and/or CMMI should require that dual-eligibles enroll in integrated plans.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Competitive bidding. As with traditional Medicare Advantage, integrated plans should compete on the basis of price to deliver the integrated dual-eligible benefit. If plans reduce utilization below the benchmark bid, they should be entitled at least half of the savings, which incentivizes them to continue to manage care after the bid has been\'a0set.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Optimizing prescription drug coverage for\'a0retirees
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Prescription drug coverage is an increasingly significant driver of Medicare spending growth, especially after the enactment of Medicare Part D, Medicare's prescription drug plan, in 2003, and the undoing of important cost controls in the Part D program by the Affordable Care Act of\'a02010.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Today, the usage of prescription drugs by seniors is highly fragmented. Drugs administered in the hospital setting are paid for by Medicare Part A; drugs administered by physicians in outpatient clinics, such as those requiring an intravenous infusion, are paid for by Medicare Part B; Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans reflect both of these modalities, while Medicare Part D plans cover drugs purchased at retail pharmacies like Walgreens and\'a0CVS.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As we describe in The Competition Prescription: A Market-Based Plan for Affordable Drugs, one way to reduce inefficiency in the way Medicare pays for drugs is to "migrate all prescription drug coverage to Medicare Part D, where pharmacy benefit managers negotiate drug prices on behalf of the Medicare program." The Competition Prescription describes other avenues for reducing the high cost of prescription drugs that would aid both those on Medicare and those using private employer-sponsored or individual market coverage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As part of a comprehensive effort to enhance the affordability of prescription drugs, in October 2018, the Trump administration released a proposal to tie the way Medicare Part B pays for physician-administered prescription drugs to an International Pricing Index (IPI) comprised of prices paid by a group of other industrialized nations: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and the United\'a0Kingdom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In response, we proposed an alternative benchmark: the Market-Based International Index. The MBII excludes industrialized countries with little room for market-based pricing, due to an absence of private insurance and the presence of regulated drug prices, but yields a pricing benchmark that is similar to that of the\'a0IPI.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 The Market-Based International Index (MBII).
\f2\b0  President Trump's proposed International Pricing Index (IPI) underemphasizes or excludes countries with market-based health care systems, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, along with countries with free (i.e., unregulated) drug pricing, such as Denmark and Singapore. The Market-Based International Index bases its benchmark on these market-based countries. (Source:\'a0FREOPP)Bipartisan reforms of the traditional Medicare\'a0program
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There are additional, incremental, bipartisan reforms that Congress should consider to reduce the underlying costs of the Medicare benefit. Two Obama-era proposals-the Simpson-Bowles National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, published in 2010; and a bipartisan proposal from former U.S. senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma; published in 2011-provide an attractive starting\'a0point:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Reduce Medicare subsidies for hospitals' uncollected bills. As the Simpson-Bowles commission noted: "Currently, Medicare reimburses hospitals and other providers for unpaid deductibles and copays owed by beneficiaries. We recommend gradually putting an end to this practice, which is not mirrored in the private sector." As a complement to this initiative, Congress should ensure that hospitals have the necessary freedoms to collect unpaid bills that exist in other industries such as credit cards and telecommunications. We estimate 30-year savings from this provision as $128\'a0billion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Exempt Part C and Part D plans from state and local sales and premium taxes. State governments frequently apply sales and premium taxes to privately administered health plans, including Medicare Part C and Part D plans, driving up their cost. Congress should exempt all health insurance plans from such taxes, by gradually phasing out their safe\'a0harbor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Replace Medicare's cost-sharing kludge with a unified annual deductible; reform Medigap insurance plans. The Lieberman-Coburn proposal notes the value of combining Medicare Parts A and B into a single insurance product for hospital and medical care, and capping the amount of money that a Medicare enrollee would have to spend out of pocket in a given year. We estimate 30-year savings from this reform of approximately $635 billion, especially if paired with reforms of so-called "Medigap" plans. (Medigap plans have proven difficult to reform, because a single organization?-?the AARP?-?generates billions of dollars in royalty fees from them. In 2017, AARP received $627 million in Medigap royalties, more than twice the $301 million the organization received in membership dues.) The Congressional Budget Office has also analyzed the potential of bundling payments for inpatient care and 90 days of post-acute outpatient care. We estimate 30-year savings from this reform of approximately $410\'a0billion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Introduce additional means-testing into Medicare Part D premiums. Introducing additional means-testing into the Medicare prescription-drug benefit, also known as Part D, could yield 30-year savings of $211\'a0billion.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Reduce waste, fraud, and abuse. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that as much as 10 percent of Medicare spending was improper in 2009. Harvard fraud expert Malcolm Sparrow has testified that "loss rates due to fraud and abuse could be 10 percent, or 20 percent, or even 30 percent in some segments."In 2012, Stephen Parente and colleagues at Fortel Analytics took a set of algorithms designed by scientists in 1993 to achieve real-time fraud prevention in the credit-card industry, and applied them to Medicare. By analyzing Medicare claims representing 20 percent of all enrollees?-?and 100 percent of enrollees for a 3 percent sample of all national Medicare providers?-?they estimated that their approach would have reduced 2009 Medicare waste by $20.7 billion in Medicare Part A, $18.1 billion in Medicare Part B, and $17.5 billion in retrospective recovery.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Restore the ability of seniors to opt out of Medicare and purchase private health coverage. In 1993, the Clinton administration passed a regulation requiring Medicare-eligible retirees to enroll in the program, or forfeit their Social Security benefits. In 2012, the rule was upheld in a 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; though the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, the high court declined to hear the case.In 2011, thenSen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and others introduced legislation to guarantee that seniors could opt out of Medicare and retain their Social Security benefits, "in accordance with a process determined by the Secretary" of Health and Human Services.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Restore the pre-ACA tax subsidy for employer-sponsored retiree coverage. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003?-?which created the Part D prescription-drug benefit?-?carved out a tax exclusion for employer-sponsored retiree prescription-drug coverage. The carve-out amounted to an effective subsidy of 28 percent of retiree prescription-drug costs, with a cap of $1,677 per beneficiary in 2010. This provision was included in the MMA to encourage employers to continue to provide privately sponsored prescription-drug coverage, instead of dropping seniors' drug coverage onto Medicare. The ACA repealed this subsidy in order to recapture $5.4 billion in federal revenue over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The subsidy should be fully restored, in order to encourage more employers to sponsor retiree health benefits.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Address the physician shortage through additional graduate medical education funding and visa expansion. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, in 2020 the United States will face a shortage of more than 91,500 physicians. The group estimates that by 2025 the physician shortage will increase to 130,600.This shortage has been exacerbated by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which capped the number of federally funded residency positions at 26,000. Catherine Dower, of the University of California at San Francisco, estimates that the federal government spent more than $11.5 billion on graduate medical education in 2012, of which $9.5 billion came from Medicare and $2 billion from Medicaid. Other federal and state agencies, such as the Defense Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the National Institutes of Health also fund graduate medical education. Congress should eliminate the physician shortage projected by the AAMC in the following ways: (1) by increasing federal funding of graduate medical education by $6 billion a year starting in 2016, contingent on a corresponding increase in residency and internship slots; (2) by separating federal funding of graduate medical education out from Medicare, Medicaid, and other agencies into a discrete congressional appropriation; and (3) by expanding the number of foreign visas for immigrant physicians who have passed U.S. medical board licensing examinations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Eliminating Medicare subsidies for multimillionaires
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At a time when Medicare is overwhelming the federal budget, it makes no sense that lower-income Americans are paying taxes so that multimillionaires can receive government subsidies to enroll in Medicare. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R., Ark.) has proposed a wide-ranging health reform proposal, the Fair Care Act of 2019, which includes a provision to eliminate eligibility for Medicare Parts B and D, and for Medigap, for individuals whose lifetime earnings have exceeded $10 million. This simple rule could reduce Medicare spending by over $100 billion over a decade, helping to extend the solvency of the program for other retirees.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Matching Medicare subsidies to modern life expectancy
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When Medicare was enacted, in 1965, the average life expectancy at birth was 70.2 years. In other words, it was anticipated that Medicare would cover an average person's health expenditures for the last 5.2 years of his life. While life expectancy has declined since 2014, when it peaked at 78.9 years, in 2016, the average American lived to the age of 78.6. Medicare thus covered the last 13.6 years of his life?-?a 162% increase in the coverage period relative to\'a01965.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unlike Social Security, whose eligibility is being gradually raised to 67 from 65 under reforms enacted in 1983, Medicare has never been adjusted for life expectancy. As the Congressional Budget Office observes, a similar adjustment to Medicare "would help Medicare return its focus to the population it originally served-people in their last years of life-and support the services most needed by that group." Importantly, under such a reform, low-income individuals would continue to be eligible for subsidized individual market coverage under the exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. They could also remain in the work force and continue to obtain coverage through employer-sponsored insurance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 An alternative-but economically equivalent-version of this reform would be to maintain Medicare's eligibility age at 65, but require the 65- and 66-year-olds of the future to enroll in Medicare Advantage, with means-tested premium subsidies that align with those in the individual market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The net effect of this change?-?especially in future decades?-?is to focus the federal government's financial resources on providing a comprehensive, modern, private-sector health insurance benefit to low-income retirees of the future, while preserving Medicare for those who are currently enrolled in the program. It encourages those who are willing and able to remain in the workforce, enhancing economic growth, tax revenue, and productivity. And it provides a modern insurance benefit, with catastrophic protection and coordinated care, to those who are in need of federal assistance.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most importantly, this approach ensures the permanent solvency of the Medicare program, by focusing the program's resources on the most elderly Americans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 could reduce federal spending by between $18 and $26 billion from 2019-2028, and by as much as $100 billion in the following decade.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Transcending Obamacare: A Patient-Centereed Plan for Near-Universal Coverage and Permanent Fiscal Solvency, we proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age by four months a year in perpetuity, so as to gradually move the United States into a system in which everyone has the opportunity to purchase means-tested private coverage on his or her own. Premiums of older seniors who remained in the traditional Medicare program would be adjusted so that they would not be affected by younger retirees moving to the individual market. Over a 30-year period, we estimate that raising the eligibility age for Medicare by four months per year would reduce Medicare spending by $6.6 trillion, with an offsetting increase in premium tax credits of $1.5 trillion, for a net spending reduction of $5.1 trillion. These savings would be even larger in future\'a0decades.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Conclusion
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Preserving Medicare for its current enrollees is an essential public priority. But so is preserving the affordability and sustainability of health care for future generations. In this lengthy and detailed report, we have explored many ways to achieve substantial savings for the Medicare program and achieve both of these objectives.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Medicare reform, emphatically, does not require reformers to choose between a fiscally sustainable future and the interests of today's retirees. By tackling inefficiencies and inequities in the program, we can expand economic opportunity for those who depend on Medicare's assistance and those who fund\'a0it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The National Minimum Wage (NMW) is a crime against the poor of this country as it absolutely forbids them from accepting any compensation below the floor set by government. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that some people who could be working are not employed because of the minimum wage.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is one way to look at it. The other is that it artificially forces up the price of labour and thus reduces the demand for labour. This law of economics has nothing to do with power dynamics, gender discrimination, racism or concerns about equality. Those issues, as far as I can tell, exist in the minds of certain academics working for institutions such as Wits.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The law of supply and demand, as well as that of prices, is foundational to economics as we know it. It is respected because it expresses a commonsense notion that is self-evidently true to anyone who has experience of the real world. When you recognise that the cost of acquiring something desirable exceeds your perceived enjoyment/utility, you simply choose not to acquire it.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 First do no harm
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is amazing that anyone could think it a good thing to raise the cost of labour through legislation when we have an official unemployment rate of 27.6%, or 38% if you include those who have given up looking for work. If you are desperate to sell anything (in this case your labour), the last thing you would do is raise its price.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In implementing the minimum wage, the key piece of "evidence" government seems to have relied on are the results of a non-standard model. What I mean by this is that they first rejected the use of computable general equilibrium models used by the likes of UCT and National Treasury because they gave what government considered to be the wrong answer. The wrong answer in this case was the prediction by these respected models that unemployment would increase if the minimum wage was raised.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not only is this a clear case of experimental bias (empirical evidence should dictate these choices, not the fact that the researcher doesn't like an outcome) but the chosen model (dimsimm) will have its own built-in assumptions. For the sake of our poor, unemployed people, I hope those assumptions are reflective of reality.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is perhaps a reflection of officialdom's supreme neglect of poor people that they are given a terrible education to depress their value as employees and then when they are ready to work, the cost of their labour is raised to above that value. In essence, government legislates for unemployment. It is not just the minimum wage, but every single piece of labour regulation that makes it more costly to hire a worker.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is not a coincidence that we have such a high rate of unemployment. There's nothing special about South Africa except that we are an emerging market with labour regulations copied from countries with hundreds of years of development and capital formation behind them. Incidentally, capital formation is the best way of raising wages without causing unemployment, but you need government to get out of the way.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Low pay, high unemployment
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Professor Valodia, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management at Wits, along with David Francis argued that if the minimum wage causes high unemployment, then we should have seen a growth in employment because of the increase in low-paid jobs since 1994. I cannot believe that a Professor would make this kind of argument.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Low-paid jobs might well increase relative to high-paid jobs but that was in spite of government and not because of any action on the part of officials to stop artificially raising the cost of labour. Lest we forget, the Labour Relations Act, passed in 1995, forces centralised collective bargaining upon employers and employees, and, in 1999, sectoral minimum wages were introduced.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It should come as no surprise that unemployment has increased steadily over time. Government concerns itself too much with what employment contracts people can sign instead of whether everyone actually has an opportunity to sign any employment contract at all.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\b\fs20 \cf0 Conclusion
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The national minimum wage is one of those curious things that demonstrates that government believes with absolute certainty that it knows better than the people themselves what is good for them. Any minimum wage presumes that people are too foolish to judge when a job would be of benefit to them or if they would be better off unemployed. I find this to be a particularly distasteful aspect of the minimum wage.

\f2\fs20 Getting yourself out of poverty is not easy and the last thing you need is some politician putting constraints on how you do it. It should be a matter of commonsense that freedom to act and cooperate is a prerequisite for building an individual's prosperity. Every door will not be opened to you, but the government elected to oversee our interests should not be in the business of shutting those very doors.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Stats SA's April Statistics of Liquidations and Insolvencies paint a very grim picture. The number of business liquidations increased by 53.1% between April 2018 and April 2019. The number of insolvencies increased by 30.1% between March 2018 and March 2019.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Given that the economy has been growing at a pedestrian 1%-2% for a few years now, it is highly unlikely that this increase is due to more businesses being opened. I believe it is safe to take these numbers at face value. South Africa is becoming an increasingly hard place to do business because of the regulatory and tax burden. Policies such as EWC (Expropriation Without Compensation) will only increase the risks of running a business here.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 South Africa still appears to be a good potential investment destination but, in some respects, possesses the worst combination of factors that exist in developing and developed nations: advanced industry and financial services alongside pockets of underdevelopment. This means that much of the low-hanging investment fruit has already been picked. To develop the economy further, we need investors who are willing to risk money in an emerging market for lower returns than other emerging markets and developed markets in many cases.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At government policy level, the investment environment should be as attractive as possible. It requires going further in economic deregulation than many other economies. Otherwise the businesses that have had to close down will not be replaced by new ones.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I personally believe that the government should use something like the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index (EFW) against which to measure policies. Other indices such as the competitiveness index, the ease of doing business index and the corruption perceptions index can be used, I am not saying that only the EFW can measure policy effectiveness but for the purposes of growing the economy and creating jobs it is the perfect tool. We should aim to reach the top global position in that index, displacing the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This would lead to a rate of economic and job growth never before seen in South Africa. It would lead to more businesses opening rather than closing. It would lead to us regaining our place as one of the world's best economic growth stories.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 President Ramaphosa has just been re-elected as President of the country. Many of the regulations making it harder for business to operate are within the power of the executive branch to kill, since the applicable laws give bureaucrats and ministers so much power in creating regulations. The president himself during an investor conference after the elections lamented the regulatory burden South Africans have to deal with.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If this was more than just rhetoric, we would expect the president and his new cabinet to start making the changes that are within their reach. We have already seen encouraging signs with the announcement that NERSA will start issuing power generation licenses for businesses at between 1-10MW per project. This is a good sign and it will surely alleviate some of our power woes but it should be followed up by other steps.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For me, the priority should be our dire labour market situation. The more businesses find it difficult to operate, the more jobs the country loses. Job creation is linked to creating a conducive environment for small business.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Government must take decisive steps to start dismantling regressive labour policies. Something in this regard can be done at the regulatory level by starting to exempt small businesses and certain categories of employment from the National Minimum Wage (NMW) as one example. Instead of a discount, the Minister of Labour can rather offer true exemptions as laid out in the Act.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Finally, I hope it is clear to everyone that the President and his cabinet have the requisite powers to start moving towards deregulating the economy. The shocking increase in liquidations and insolvencies should spur government officials to action considering the fact that 38% or 9,994,000 adults are sitting at home unemployed. Policies such as EWC and government fiscal irresponsibility inherent in policies such as the NHI will only make it even harder for business to operate.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The latest GDP numbers show that the South African economy declined by 3.2 percent for the first quarter of 2019. This comes after President Ramaphosa announced a R50 billion stimulus package in September 2018. Since that stimulus followed on a decade of stimulus spending instituted since the 2008 global economic crisis, we must now ask whether Minister Pravin Gordhan's decision to choose stimulus over austerity was the right one.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa's rand fell early on Thursday to its lowest this year. This comes as a dispute within the ruling African National Congress over the central bank weakened demand. At 0800 GMT, the rand was 0.15 percent weaker at 14.8850 per dollar compared with an overnight close of 14.8600. It tumbled to a session low of 14.9625, its weakest since October, before settling near 14.80. - Africa News
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Of course, these dire GDP numbers also reflect the failure of Eskom to provide a reliable electricity supply. For this, we must thank the department of energy's IRP document which didn't provide for deregulating the energy sector. South Africa is currently facing the consequences of bad government decision-making across the board. The twin evils of government spending (which means high taxes) and regulation are harming the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In just the first quarter of 2019, we have seen increases in liquidations, insolvencies, and unemployment. At the same time exports have decreased by 26.4 percent and gross fixed capital formation by 4.5\'a0percent (the fifth consecutive decline) meaning that the investments needed to set the stage for future growth are declining in real terms. I believe it is not an exaggeration to say South Africa is de-industrializing.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If the government is a sector of the economy, it is one that grows at the point of a gun, benefitting from behavior that is illegal if done by anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa has yet to come out of the recession of 2009. This despite the finance minister of the time, Pravin Gordhan, launching the process that would take government debt from 22.6 percent of GDP and bump it up to the current 55.6 percent of GDP. Instead of being a bulwark against the "nine wasted years", the minister was a key enabler of the looting and economic stagnation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the meantime, countries like Estonia that chose the harder, less popular road of fiscal austerity have recovered and are creating jobs and participating in the fourth industrial revolution instead of trying to hide behind empty rhetoric. Estonia in 2009 experienced a decline of 14.72 percent in GDP while South Africa experienced a decline of a mere 1.54 percent. The Estonian government cut spending, including salaries of civil servants, while South Africa increased spending, especially on civil servants.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The result is that Estonia grew by 3.9\'a0percent in 2018, their third consecutive year of above 3 percent growth. South Africa meanwhile grew by 0.8\'a0percent in 2018 and last experienced 3\'a0percent growth in 2011. Correspondingly, South Africa went from 82nd in the world in 2008 to 110th in 2016 in the Economic Freedom of the World index produced by the Fraser Institute.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To make matters worse, in South Africa, signs of reform are nowhere to be found. The government is pursuing policies such as Expropriation Without Compensation (EWC) in an environment where private sector investment is in decline. As the President's intervention of 2018 shows, the "new dawn" president is just as committed to fiscal stimulus as his predecessor was. There are no signs that anyone in government has the political will to cut spending on the civil service and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in particular.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Indeed, Minister Gordhan, unlike Minister Mboweni, has expressed a misguided hope that the Soviet and the apartheid era dinosaurs that are our SOEs can be transformed into profitable business concerns. He has done this while overruling the Eskom board and management for trying to introduce reforms i.e., refusing to increase the pay of Eskom's bloated workforce. Those who hope that President Ramaphosa can take a leaf from Margaret Thatcher's book should remember that there's a reason why James Callaghan and Harold Wilson failed: The Labour Party was allied to the trade unions.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is telling that only three sectors grew this quarter. One of these is the government which added 0.2 percentage points to the GDP. The mere fact that the government is included in the growth numbers is an aberration. The government can only grow at the expense of every other part of the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is because government grows only when it taxes our productive endeavors. It doesn't need to provide any value to consumers or convince them not to buy from any other entity. If the government is a sector of the economy, it is one that grows at the point of a gun, benefitting from behavior that is illegal if done by anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To further illustrate the de-industrialization point, manufacturing was the biggest contributor to the drop in GDP at -1.1 percentage points. The insecurity of energy supply is just one of the problems our government has saddled us with by moving at a snail's pace (if at all) towards allowing the willing and able private sector to pick up Eskom's slack.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most of our problems have been inflicted on us by the government, especially the decision to abandon the fiscal prudence of President Mbeki and Minister Trevor Manuel. South Africans will continue to suffer as long as the private sector is demonized and not allowed to do what it does best.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on 20 June. The speech was filled with rousing language as well as conciliatory offers to work together with members of the opposition. Unfortunately, no new details of his ostensible reform agenda were released, including details of how his dream for South Africa will come about.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa does not lack for promises from politicians. If the President thought that this is what we needed, then his advisors didn't do their job. President Zuma, for instance, promised to halve unemployment by 2019 and have the economy growing at more than 5 percent. Of course, conveniently, the promise was made for after the end of his term in office. President Ramaphosa has also made promises to be fulfilled after his second and last term (10 years from now), presuming he does get a second term.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his State of the Nation Address on Thursday in Parliament. Some members of parliament felt that the President is unrealistic in his plan to make South Africa better. -News24
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The promises themselves are good visions for the future. It is important to dream and set ambitious goals. We do that in our own lives; the difference being that we do not allow ourselves to entertain any dream unless we are willing to put in the hard work to achieve it. Otherwise, it's simply a fantasy and it will never happen.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The President seemed to be suffering under no such constraints. He promised to create 2 million jobs for young people while simultaneously boasting about the National Minimum Wage that he negotiated with unions and big business, which keeps people out of work. He also promised that every 10-year old will be able to read with understanding, yet nothing was said about how he will convince the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) to allow a teacher meritocracy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We were promised that economic growth will significantly outpace growth in population, effectively referring to a high GDP per capita growth. In 2017 this was 0.1 percent, while for Rwanda it was 3.5 percent. The President did not give any indication that South Africa will be embarking on the type of free-market reforms that the Rwandan government instituted to surpass South Africa in the Economic Freedom of the World index.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A vision of the future is important but visions that are only meant to come into fruition when the visionary is no longer in office, especially when no credible plan is presented, should be looked at with suspicion. Why can't the President mention a few of the reforms that are needed to achieve some of these dreams? Is it the case that we, the people who vote for him, cannot be trusted, or rather that we do not matter enough? It is easy to make promises about that on which no one can hold you to account.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We can't really blame politicians for treating us with contempt, however, as citizens have shown great reluctance in holding them accountable. The President knows that he can keep making promises and he doesn't need to fulfill any of them, in the same way, that Zuma did.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It would be great for South Africa to achieve the goals set out in the President's five promises - a new smart city would be impressive. The brutal fact is that current policies will achieve the very opposite. That is why the Free Market Foundation champions the policies that can achieve these ideals. School vouchers, for instance, would not exclude any poor person and would also provide a market incentive to make sure that all 10-year olds can read for understanding. Yet the government is not even considering vouchers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The government keeps telling us that it is looking for constructive criticism. That is exactly what free marketeers do, but we get ignored. Then something goes wrong and the free market is blamed. The fact is that President Ramaphosa did not announce anything to radically alter South Africa's statist, collectivist paradigm.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The government sounds, for all intents and purposes, as if it is going to continue doubling down on the policies that have failed South Africa for the last few decades. Ordinary people will continue to be threatened since they are not trusted. We see this in the fact that the President's speech was all about government doing things for us, and nothing about us doing things for ourselves with the government stepping out of the way. That, more than anything else, has doomed the President's 10-year promises, and this is only the first week.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Why are people afraid of vaccines? The already strong evidence of their safety got stronger in March with the release of a large Danish study that addressed several objections to previous studies and found that the measles vaccine poses no additional risk of developing autism.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Yet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported April 26 that there have been 704 cases of measles so far this year. "The suffering we are seeing today is completely avoidable," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Monday. "We know vaccines are safe because they're among some of the most studied medical products we have."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So why does skepticism persist? One reason is that scientists, physicians and journalists are overly dismissive of the observations that circulate among the public. In a 2015 presidential debate, Donald Trump said an employee had a 2-year-old daughter who "went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic." Media commentaries accused Mr. Trump of trafficking in conspiracy theories. But what if his account was true?
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It was anecdotal, and experts know the plural of "anecdote" isn't 
\f4\i\b \ul data. Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  advances by collecting and analyzing data in rigorous and meaningful ways. A study led by neurologist Samuel Berkovic applied that approach to vaccine reactions, and the results provide a model for understanding and overcoming skepticism about the safety of vaccines.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Berkovic and his colleagues studied a genetic form of epilepsy caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene, a DNA sequence that specifies part of a channel in nerve-cell membranes that allows sodium ions to enter the cell. Children born with such SCN1A mutations are destined to develop seizures and regress neurologically. The researchers found that the onset of these seizures peaked in the days after vaccination but then dipped below baseline in subsequent weeks. The net result was that vaccines had no effect on the likelihood of developing the inevitable deterioration from these mutations.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is, vaccines did trigger the deterioration - but had the children not been vaccinated, the same deterioration would have occurred anyway the next time they had a cold. These results are fully consistent with the large-population studies. But by studying the detailed time course in a genetically characterized population, they illustrated how vaccines can appear to be the proximate cause of an injury, yet the ultimate cause is genetic.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When parents ask me about vaccines, I inspire confidence by telling them that my three kids got all the recommended vaccinations on schedule. But when dealing with public policy about mandatory vaccinations, one needs to address the elephant in the room: the stories of deterioration following vaccinations. Many experts prefer to ignore such anecdotes, and when engaged in public debate, find it hard to resist the ethos of an advocate - pushing the conclusion but playing down the complexity. That's been counterproductive. People hear stories about neurological deteriorations and trust their friends more than the experts. Unless we act like scientists and explain the science, we won't be effective in helping laymen put the anecdotes in context.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Someday we may identify newborns at risk for genetically determined neurological deteriorations and intervene, preventing the fever and inflammation from colds and vaccinations from triggering deterioration. We don't yet know how to do that, and people should follow recommendations to get vaccinated. Vaccinations don't make these genetic susceptibilities worse, and they prevent the contagions that used to kill thousands a year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If you remain unvaccinated, you run the risk of getting infected as an adult, when diseases like chickenpox and measles are far likelier to be fatal. If you become infected, you also risk the lives of others who are most vulnerable to infection.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The University of South Florida is creating a new program focused on solving traffic congestion, using a $7.5 million grant announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 USF was one of 50 applicants for the grant, which will fund the National Institute for Congestion Reduction. Housed in the College of Engineering, it will be the department's only national center focused on addressing congestion challenges facing the country's urban areas.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "As a preeminent research university located in the heart of the metropolitan Tampa Bay area, the University of South Florida has always been focused on the unique issues and challenges facing modern American cities," USF president Judy Genshaft said in a news release. "This designation is an affirmation of our leadership in this kind of meaningful applied research."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 USF will partner with other recipients of the department's grant monies: University of California Berkeley, Texas A&M University and the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\'fcez. The program at USF will use emerging technology and 
\f4\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  to create innovative transportation options, the news release said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "We hope the impacts of these coordinated activities will be felt by the transportation industry, agencies and practitioners long after the life cycle of this grant is completed," said Florida Department of Transportation secretary Kevin Thibault, adding that the state is looking forward to working with USF.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Robert Bishop, dean of the College of Engineering, said the new program will serve as another example of how USF's research achieves positive societal impact.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What did Biko mean when he said this? Did he mean that putting people with a black skin colour in power would automatically solve all our problems? I look around this continent and although I see black people running governments and those governments running economies, we are still the dark continent. The best of us leave for greener pastures, not because we no longer like the sun, but because we do not have the freedom to express our inherent brilliance.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Since independence, our politicians have engaged in one socialist experiment after another, driven by the idea that African traditional societies were communal and did not value free markets. Ghanaian economist George Ayittey has dismantled this idea, but it still persists among intellectuals and politicians. These misguided experiments have led to us being the least economically free continent on earth with a mean Economic Freedom Score of 5.73. The Americas have the next lowest score of 6.59 while Oceania has the best score of 7.25.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is not hard to see why we are the poorest continent. We just do not trust our own people enough despite all the rhetoric around black affirmation and consciousness. Our government does not trust us with freedom and the dire conditions on the continent are the result. Anyone who genuinely cares about uplifting black people and solving the self-esteem issue that seems to affect us disproportionately, to bring about a true African renaissance, will realise that solving the economic problems is of the utmost importance.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 We know what to do, there are decades of clear evidence that economic freedom leads to economic prosperity. The fact that we have ignored this for so long, the fact that there are only two African countries in the first quartile of economic freedom (Mauritius at #8 and Rwanda at #40), should have us hanging our heads in shame. Why do we put up with this? Why do South Africans accept their country being 110th in the world in the EFW (Economic Freedom of the World)?

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is a symptom of a people who do not have confidence in themselves, who do not fundamentally believe they are worthy of freedom. We keep accepting bad ideas on our beautiful and bountiful continent because, despite what the Pan-Africanists say, we do not believe that we can handle the responsibility that comes with freedom. I believe Biko would be sad to see the sorry state we are in.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 We will not get anywhere if we do not accept the primacy of the individual and their rights, chief among these being property. This is not to say that people who endured dispossession should not get restitution for what they lost. In fact, a society that values individual freedom takes care to treat those individuals justly, therefore everyone who had their property stolen now or in the past should get it back. This is non-negotiable. We, ordinary citizens, should be at the forefront of fighting for everyone's property rights. The mistake we should never make is to assign these rights to groups instead of individuals as this serves no one's interests except those of the power-hungry.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In a democracy, it is convenient for politicians to unite some groups around an issue regardless of whether pursuing this issue makes us better or worse off. They invent demons for which they then set themselves up as exorcists, at a fee of course, the taxes you have to hand over to them. We need to stop falling for this trick and realise that prosperity can never occur in an environment of wealth destruction and diminished freedom.

A continent that exports its most valuable human capital to places where it is needed the least. This has to stop. Here, in South Africa, we should have a target of being the top-ranked country on the EFW within the next five years. That means cutting state spending and taxes, selling SOEs, deregulating across the economy - especially in the labour market and allowing people to sign employment contracts that we may not agree with but which are an expression of the will of free individuals.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Poverty has been decreasing in Africa as countries have gradually liberalised their economies, yet the South African government has chosen to go in the opposite direction and citizens are bearing the brunt. Countries like Rwanda and Ethiopia are growing their economies and eliminating poverty, but we are stagnating and losing our coveted place as the most industrialised nation on the continent.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Here in South Africa the spectre of poverty haunts everyone. That is why we are driven to work and invest. Investment costs have dropped drastically with the rise of new platforms and financial instruments like easyequities.co.za and Exchange Traded Funds. Anyone earning an income can save for the future and set themselves on the way to banishing poverty from their lives forever. All it takes is self-discipline. Skin colour has nothing to do with it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Of course, to invest requires some income and this is where we have government setting up a barrier of labour regulations that prevent poor people from getting jobs. Much has been written on this but suffice it to say it need not be an insurmountable problem to get everyone on the first rung of the income ladder, which will happen if only government could be convinced to stop interfering in employment contracts and investment in the economy.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This also has nothing to do with being black, even though most victims of government obstacles are black people because this group is catching up from far behind everyone else due to apartheid.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Making it is never guaranteed, especially for people who do not save or have a habit of getting into debt to finance consumption spending. No matter how much you earn, if you don't save, you're more than likely to end up poor. While it is never guaranteed, you can ensure that you have a very high chance of making it by denying yourself niceties like partying, luxury cars and expensive clothes. This is how members of the Indian community in South Africa have largely erased the negative effects of apartheid on themselves.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Fanon was wrong. We are poor because African leaders chose the failed ideas of controlled economies instead of letting individuals be masters of their own fate. Some countries are slowly turning their economies around and Africa is starting to rise as a result. Therefore, it is not blackness, the climatic adaptation, keeping us poor but it is rather blackness the ideology, which is popular on this continent and which, unfortunately, has at its foundation failed socialist ideas - ideas that have a 100% record of making people poor.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is the nature of any market that any position is never secure, that's why companies like Edcon can go into bankruptcy and others like Capitec can rise to challenge dominant players. That is why any prudent investor sacrifices higher returns in exchange for less risk and thereby protects their wealth, that is why insurance exists, that is why the strategy of diversification is championed by every responsible financial adviser.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If being in a state of poverty makes you feel inferior, that is understandable but also unhelpful. You need to deal with your internal psychological state and then figure out how to get yourself out of poverty. There are many black people who don't have these feelings of inferiority, so fix yourself or else you are just getting in your own way.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is not clear how "black child it's possible" is a lie. Of course it's possible because so many others have done it and maintained it. People like Patrice Motsepe have built empires that will likely outlive them. Assuming his descendants are equally business-savvy, the Motsepe wealth will last forever. Sadly, this is rarely the case, even in developed countries, as the generation that makes the wealth tends to hand it over to those who lose it. This is why many wealthy people put their money in trusts that restrict how their descendants can use it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is not clear to me what the choice between "assimilation" and "making it" is. If acquiring and using knowledge on wealth-building is assimilation, don't be surprised if you stay poor thinking like that. If, on the other hand, it means giving up your own culture in order to gain an income and start saving, this, clearly, is not true. I am a proud Zulu man and I know many others who save and invest money while continuing to practice their cultures to the fullest.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The only structural impediments to black people making it now are the policies of the present government: the regulations, taxes and policies like expropriation without compensation which lead to insecure property holdings. Secure property rights are the engine which built the prosperity of the West and now Asia. If government doesn't acknowledge this, we will continue to have black poverty. After all, who do you think is most affected by the feudal system that operates in the former homelands where land is not held by individuals but by the state?

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Small business is widely acknowledged as the engine of economic growth in both developing and developed economies. The South African government also recognises this. President Ramaphosa said during the 2019 SONA (state of the nation address):
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "Given the key role that small businesses play in stimulating economic activity and employment - and in advancing broad-based empowerment - we are focusing this year on significantly expanding our small business incubation programme."
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Government-run business incubators will undoubtedly incur some costs on the fiscus on an ongoing basis, even if we put aside the question of the efficacy of government-run incubators. There are easier and likely more effective ways of promoting small business, boosting economic growth and creating jobs.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I analysed the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index with the aim of identifying the sub-variables that would have the greatest positive impact on gdp per capita growth. It turns out that reducing/eliminating administrative requirements (applying for permits, government reporting requirements, regulations etc) could add as much as 0.21 percentage points to the gdp per capita growth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In practical terms, this means that government should have an official policy of minimal interference in business. In particular, adding new compliance rules periodically even if some are eliminated, is counter-productive.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Every minute spent filling out a government form or trying to understand some new regulation is a minute not spent producing. The cumulative effect of this can be devastating to a developing economy such as ours.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The basic problem in South Africa is that while engaging in rhetoric about how important entrepreneurs are and how we need them, politicians simultaneously introduce laws and regulations that make it harder for these entrepreneurs to do what they are good at. It seems that government may be suffering from an inability to understand constraints: whatever "good" thing you aim for and try to achieve is at the cost of achieving something else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Regulations on business are a case in point. Government recognises that entrepreneurs are necessary for solving South Africa's socio-economic problems but it also wants to achieve other objectives like: favouring unionised workers in employment contracts, collecting the different kinds of taxes it levies, sector-specific objectives etc. It never acknowledges that some of these objectives contradict others. This means that government needs to prioritise. Politicians need to decide what is most important to their constituents and develop policy that reflects these priorities. Unfortunately, we do not live in a world where you can have it all, at the same time.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 South Africa is currently ranked 98th in terms of the EFW's administrative requirements variable. Rwanda is ranked 3rd in the world and, in 2017, had a gdp per capita growth rate of 3.57% while the same figure for South Africa was 0.07%. This is a clear indication that South Africa will soon be overtaken by countries like Rwanda in terms of standard of living if the necessary reforms are not elevated to being a matter of urgency.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The medicine for what ails this country has been discovered, tried, tested and proved over hundreds of years. It is simply a matter, even if some vested political interests find it to be bitter, of whether, to develop a prosperous country, we are indeed willing to take it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It has become an accepted premise among some South Africans that the current government is responsible for the troubles facing Eskom, whether it is the financial position of the utility being compromised by corruption or so-called policy sabotage when the government barred the company from building more power stations in the late 1990s.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This type of analysis makes sense on the face of it since there's a clear line between cause (corruption, incompetence) and effect (the imminent collapse of Eskom, loadshedding).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The problem with clear-cut, emotionally satisfying answers is that they are often wrong. Nicholas Woode-Smith, an author and managing editor of the Rational Standard, has done an economic analysis of Eskom using principles from the Austrian school of economics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is clear from Woode-Smith's work that the core problem of everything that is wrong with Eskom is its structure as a monopoly provider of electricity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Eskom simply does not have the means to receive and interpret the vital market signals necessary to calculate what its electricity price should be.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When demand increases, because Eskom is a political entity, it cannot adjust prices accordingly to reflect this increased demand, and thus has to violate a fundamental law of economics.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If Eskom were allowed to adjust prices based on demand, sadly, it would still provide electricity inefficiently due to the lack of competition inherent in its legislated monopoly, but, at least it would then be able to ensure its own survival, albeit at the cost of consumers and the economy generally.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The situation as it is now, Eskom is harming both itself and the economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Corruption at Eskom didn't start with Jacob Zuma or even in 1994. Back in 1984, the assistant chief accountant was caught embezzling R8 million.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There were blackouts too in the past due to an inability to match demand with supply. These and other problems led to the appointment of the De Villiers commission in 1984.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Eskom was always doomed to fail. It started failing long before the democratic era.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The fundamental reason why Eskom is doomed to fail is its structure as a state-owned, monopoly provider of electricity.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is often claimed that if Eskom were to be privatised, the poor would suffer the most.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Well, that depends on whether you want them to suffer a little now or a lot more so in the future.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A market for electricity would introduce price competition, which, unlike Eskom's political prices, would be market driven and would be sustainable.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Future consumers would not have to pay the price they do today.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is worth remembering that we have had average annual increases in the electricity price of 12.46% since 2009.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Cumulatively speaking and taking account of inflation, this amounts to 119.61% over the March 2009 electricity price.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This, on its own, destroys the argument for keeping Eskom's legislated monopoly for "the sake of the poor".
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The poor would likely not have been subjected to such large increases in so short an amount of time if private electricity providers had been allowed to compete with Eskom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 I believe that looking back to a mythical golden age when Eskom was beating the laws of economics contributes nothing to the urgent debate we need to have about how energy should be provided to the South African economy.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Should we continue sustaining Eskom at any cost, a company that has never been sustainable, or, rather, should we accept the laws of economics that have worked time and time again and leave energy provision to the market?

\f2\fs20 \cf0 THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Andrew Gillum is launching a campaign that could change the dynamics of the 2020 election - even if he didn't announce a plan to run for president.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At a Wednesday rally at Florida Memorial University's Miami Gardens campus, Gillum rolled out an ambitious initiative to register one million new voters ahead of the presidential election. The Florida Democratic Party that it's also spending $2 million to register 200,000 new voters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "I'm tapping into that network - what we built from the campaign, the enthusiasm, the volunteers, the infrastructure, the assets there - and trying to turn all of that energy and effort into registering and engaging one million voters in advance of the 2020 election," the 39-year-old former Tallahassee mayor and past gubernatorial candidate told the Miami Herald.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Florida Democrats hope to reinforce a slipping voter advantage in a crucial swing state that voted for Donald Trump two years ago after twice casting its vote for Barack Obama.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Over the 10 years from the time Obama was first elected in 2008 to the November midterms, Florida Democrats saw a 700,000-voter lead over Republicans dwindle to roughly 260,000.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And that lead didn't hold up when it came to voter participation in the fall when, despite Democratic gains around the country, Republican voters turned out in greater numbers than Democrats and propelled Ron DeSantis to a win of less than half a percentage point over Gillum.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So, after receiving plenty of help courting new voters during his campaign from registration-minded political organizations like Tom Steyer's NextGen America, Gillum said he hopes to build on the enthusiasm that resulted in a roughly 33 percent statewide turnout increase over the 2014 midterms.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the same time, he also wants to do more to reach out to unlikely and unregistered voters around the state, but particularly in places like South Florida, where some party activists felt that the Democratic Party did too little to court Hispanic and black voters in the past election.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "To me, it's absolutely critical, not just to this election cycle but to the future of politics in the state of Florida, to get back into the business of engaging people where they live, talking to them outside the election and being in contact with them," Gillum said. "So when we do reach out to them for their vote they're not saying, 'It's been a long time and I haven't talked to you. Why should we believe in you?' "
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Miami-Dade County was among the regions where turnout among Democratic voters was low compared to the rest of the state, one of the key reasons Gillum lost the race. He said South Florida remains one of the most important areas for connecting with unregistered and disenfranchised voters.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "From a numbers perspective, South Florida is where a heavy percentage of these new voters are going to come from. The population there is one that I think is critical for us when we consider communities largely left out or left behind," he said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Gillum says the effort won't be entirely partisan, but he plans to work in conjunction with the Florida Democratic Party and left-leaning organizations like New Florida Majority and Florida Immigration Coalition. In announcing their own effort Wednesday, Florida Democrats said there are more than 4 million eligible but unregistered voters in the state, and the party "will be partnering with

\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  firms and building out infrastructure to grow the ranks of registered Democrats."

\f2\fs20 Gillum declined in an interview to explicitly say that he isn't going to run for the party's nomination in 2020, although he indicated in a New York Times interview that he's closed that door.

\f2\fs20 Hurricane a disaster for Florida prisons
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After Hurricane Michael hit the Panhandle, a key portion of the state's corrections system was crippled, leaving nearly 300 prison employees displaced and more than 5,000 relocated inmates packing facilities across Florida.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 New figures obtained by the News Service of Florida show a significant problem in a region where a sizable part of the workforce is employed by the corrections system and a good chunk of the state's inmate population is housed.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It has taken months to know exactly how bad the Oct. 10 storm has impacted the region's 23 prisons. But officials with the Florida Department of Corrections said last week that in addition to tens of millions of dollars in damage to facilities, the storm also displaced 284 prison employees, increased job vacancies and forced shifting 5,000 inmates to facilities across the state.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nearly 800 prison employees who lost or sustained severe damage to their homes in the storm have received a total of $450,000 in assistance from the Corrections Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to aid the Department of Corrections.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The department is also struggling to fill vacancies in the hurricane-impacted areas. Before the hurricane hit, the region's 23 prisons had a vacancy rate of 12 percent. As of Feb. 22, that vacancy rate had ticked up to 14 percent, with vacancies for prison guards and probation officers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Michael Van Sickler and Amy Hollyfield contributed to this report, which also uses information from the News Service of Florida.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Officially, for the 2019/20 financial year, government will not be increasing income taxes. The only taxes set to increase are the indirect taxes: fuel levies, excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes, and the new carbon tax coming into effect on 1 June 2019. With these increases government estimates that it will raise an additional R1.2 billion.\'a0  
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb60\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yet, government's plan is to raise an additional R15 billion in the coming financial year, mostly to fund the R23 billion a year set to be handed over to Eskom over the next three years. So where will the other R13.8 billion in planned increases come from? 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is where it gets interesting. Even though government is not officially raising any income tax (income tax is expected to make up 41.3% of tax revenue), because of the phenomenon of bracket creep, government expects to raise R12.8 billion from income taxes, and the remaining R1 billion will come from not raising the medical tax credit. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Bracket creep happens when an individual moves from a lower into a higher tax bracket due to an increase in salary to offset inflation. In previous years, government would adjust the income tax brackets upwards to ensure no one would pay more in tax while their income still bought the same thing. If bracket creep is not accounted for, it would mean the inflation-linked salary increase of taxpayers near the upper limit of a tax bracket would be eroded through taxes. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Technically, the government has done a partial creep adjustment by increasing the threshold for taxable income from R78,150 p/a to R79,000 p/a, a mere 1.1% increase in the threshold. Leaving the medical tax credit unchanged means it has actually been reduced in real terms. The net result is that everyone who has income near the thresholds (including people who were not paying any income tax last year) will be paying increased taxes, and everyone who has medical aid (because the state healthcare services are atrocious) will also be paying more tax. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The least government could have done is be honest about these tax increases. Instead, in effect, it is using inflation to avoid owning up to a tax increase during an election year. This is deceitful and a means to avoid democratic accountability for decisions taken by our representatives on our behalf. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The worst thing about this stealth tax increase is that most of it is going towards funding the inefficient Eskom. In the end it will likely be for nought since Eskom has displayed an inability to change for the better and still has more than R400 billion of debt on its books. Throwing good money after the bad that is Eskom is not a good justification for making hard-working South Africans poorer. The fact that government is taking more of the money you choose to spend on private healthcare makes it that much worse. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The last point I will make is that taxes are likely to rise even further in the medium term. There is evidence that government has already passed the turning point of the Laffer curve (the point at which additional tax increases lead to less rather than more revenue due in part to a growing state crowding out the private sector), revenue collection has been suffering and targets keep getting revised downwards. There is also the fact that debt-servicing costs (interest on government debt) are projected to grow by 22.4% over the medium term from a projected R202.2 billion this year to R247.4 billion by 2021/22. Debt servicing costs are always paid for in taxes. When a country can no longer raise the necessary taxes, it has no choice but to default on its debt.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          Imagine for a moment that after a herculean effort raising capital you are able to start a business. A business that employs some people in your community who, previously, had been living in poverty. A business serving the needs of its customers, consenting adults who also happen to be poor.

\f2\fs20 \cf0  Now imagine a politician comes into town and tells you that your business must be shut down because it fails to adhere to some obscure condition in your licence. Something like this happened when the MEC for Economic Development in Kwa-Zulu Natal, visited my hometown of Newcastle.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  The story, as reported by the Newcastle Advertiser (there's an accompanying video) is that the MEC came into town on 19 February and started flexing his muscles. A tavern owner was threatened with the withdrawal of his operating licence because patrons were drinking on his property, not the government's property. His customers are presumably adults who gave him their custom willingly.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  The MEC arrived with immigration officials who arrested a man of Congolese origin, not for doing anything violent but for simply being a human being who was born on the wrong side of an arbitrary line called a border. The officials arresting this innocent man were heard (on the video) saying in Zulu: "Put some handcuffs on him, I want him to feel pain."
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  As if that was not enough, the MEC took it upon himself to order the removal of two shipping containers being used on the man's property as a hair salon and a barber shop. The entire exercise was a violation of one individual's property rights using the flimsy excuses of bylaws and legislation, all for some superficial political reasons rather than the constitutional rights that are supposed to define our society.

\f2\fs20 \cf0  The Economic Development Department showed its true colours to the people of Newcastle. It seems to want exactly the opposite of what its name suggests. Far from promoting economic development, it appears intent on shutting down every avenue for the economic upliftment of the people of Newcastle, a sad state of affairs given that, according to the 2011 census, my hometown had a 37.4% unemployment rate using the official definition. This was at 49% for the youth (15-34 year-olds).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  These actions of a provincial department in an election year show us exactly why South Africans are suffering. This kind of strong-arm behaviour is a major reason why there are almost 10 million unemployed people in the country. Political considerations outweigh the economic needs of the citizenry. Politicians would rather shut down productive businesses, businesses that create employment, if those businesses are not the ones politicians approve of.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  If this kind of thinking continues, what is already a tragic situation is likely to be made worse. The simple fact is that South Africans have it within themselves to get out of poverty without any government help but the government, under the guise of offering assistance, keeps getting in their way.

\f2\fs20 \cf0  Trade with each other is how humans build prosperity, utilising what they have available to them to build and get what they want. Nothing can stop this inevitable march to progress except the use of violence. Government's (un)liberal use of mafia tactics against peaceful business owners are a symptom of this regressive force.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There is no denying that we live in the most technologically advanced era the Earth has ever seen and this is due to property rights and free trade. Removing restrictions on trade between individuals in a country is important but removing restrictions on trade between individuals in different countries is arguably even more important given the enormous size of the global market compared to any single country's domestic market. This also means that investors are spoiled for choice as to where to put their money.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is therefore almost suicidal that South Africa has such onerous foreign exchange regulations. These govern everything from the capital you can bring into the country to the profits you can take out. Most egregious is that these rules are often not objective but dependent on the whims of officials in the Reserve Bank and National Treasury.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It should be obvious that such an array of regulations makes it much less likely that foreigners will put their money here. Navigating South Africa's regulatory framework - not just forex controls - is a complex task compared to countries like Ireland and Singapore. Singapore places the least restrictions on foreign investors while Ireland is the fifth least restrictive according to their rankings in the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index (2018) published by the Fraser Institute.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Interestingly, Singapore experienced 3.53% growth in gdp per capita in 2017 and Ireland a growth rate of 6.50%, while South Africa growth rate was a mere 0.07%. The data on gdp per capita growth comes from the World Bank.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 From a data analysis I performed examining which variables in the EFW were most important in ensuring gdp per capita grow within one year, the foreign ownership/investment restrictions variable emerged as the third most important using regression analysis. Moving from the most restrictive to the least restrictive regime for foreign investors could add as much as 0.45 percentage points to the gdp per capita growth. In South Africa in 2017, this would have meant going from 0.07% to 0.52% growth. Keep in mind that growth in gdp per capita accounts for population size and growth automatically.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The EFW variable is based on a two-part World Economic Forum survey question designed to elicit executive perceptions on two aspects:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The prevalence of foreign ownership.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A country's restriction of international capital flows.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The first can only be improved indirectly, but the second can be dealt with more directly by, for instance, removing the caps on foreign capital transfers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is not that we would be doing foreign investors a favour by removing onerous regulations. In a world where capital has gone global, it is counterproductive not to do everything in our power to attract a significant amount of that capital to this country. Doing so means significantly lessening the risks for investors by assuring them in law and regulation, of the ability to transfer their profits to whichever jurisdiction they may choose. This is important because if you are an investor, no matter how nice the current government is, you want the certainty that you will be able to protect your property by moving it offshore if a bad government were to take power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is especially true in emerging markets. The South African government is also currently pursuing a policy of Expropriation Without Compensation which was preceded by unilaterally cancelling bilateral investment treaties. This must be a point of concern for any potential investor.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A final point I want to make is that we are in the lucky position of having the choice to attract capital from more developed countries. That is why developing countries can become rich much quicker than what it took for the West to become rich because there was very little built-up capital then and there is an abundance of it nowadays. We should be taking advantage of this. Globalisation is good for developing countries.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 You cannot produce anything without capital.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If all capital is centrally controlled by the state, you will not produce as much as a society that allows free individuals to own property (all capital is property and some property is capital).
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is because central control has no mechanism for distributing capital to those who will use it most efficiently.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There are no signals to indicate to those who control capital as to how much to produce because there is no market and, therefore, also no market prices.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is why the freest economies like Hong Kong and the United States do exponentially better than restricted economies like Venezuela and Cuba.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It makes no sense to be against capital or capitalists since without either one we wouldn't have our modern conveniences, the things that make us producers (capitalists) in our own right as well as the things we use for our own amusement and comfort.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is a mystery to me why labour should be expected to be against capital, since the collaboration of these two groups of people make everyone better off, especially the employees and their employers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The essential requirements before production can take place are private ownership of capital and a free market.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This relationship is illustrated most succinctly in the Economic Freedom of the World annual reports which compares economic freedom with per capita production (GDP per capita) in a country:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Source: World Bank GDP per capita 2011 prices PPP and Economic Freedom of the World Index 2018
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The preceding graph shows the average GDP per capita between 1990 and 2016 in each quartile of economic freedom.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is unambiguous: higher economic freedom leads to higher economic output.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If this doesn't convince you that we need economic freedom in order to have wealth, perhaps it is because there is a perception that all the benefits of production go to the owners of the capital and not to the workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is simply not true. In a country that produces more, everyone is better off, especially the workers.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It is true that higher economic production leads to greater investment in capital (machinery and things like computers) but what we find is that this investment benefits workers, perhaps more than anyone else.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The more capital owners invest to increase their own wealth also leads to higher labour productivity and this greater productivity inevitably leads to higher wages for labour.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As soon as any company makes more money per employee, competitors soon adopt the same technology, and, when all of the companies have more to spend on labour, to attract and keep the good workers from the available pool of labour, they have to pay more or else they lose those good workers to their competitors.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The great advantage that labour has over capital (machines and the like) is its mobility.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each individual worker is a rational actor, whereas a machine cannot decide what is in its own interests and can only do what the owner requires of it.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Labour has no such constraints except in centrally planned societies where governments force workers to produce for "the good of society".
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The idea of "from each according to his ability and to each according to his need" sounds good in theory until you realise the horrific implications for individual agency.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 You, as a worker, as much as any businessman, should do what is in your best interests and not have to accept whatever crumbs are given to you based on the lowest common denominator of your society.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The evidence that higher investments in capital lead to higher wages is pretty clear. Illustrated in the following graph is the relationship between capital formation per employee and earnings per employee across all countries and years for which data was available from the World Bank:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The relationship is quite obvious but for the statistically-inclined among you: I found a 0.97 Pearson correlation co-efficient at the 1% significance level (my computer rounded off the p-value to 0, the relationship was so strong) meaning that the probability that there is no correlation between the two variables is much less than 1%.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Therefore, we have shown that:
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 1) Economic freedom leads to higher production, and since production requires capital, it is self-evidently true that economic freedom leads to higher rates of capital formation; and
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 2) Once you have higher rates of capital formation, workers get higher incomes. And yes, you will never get rid of inequality because risk is not equally distributed, among other things, but workers in freer (more capitalist) economies will do better than workers in less-free economies.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The idea that labour and capital have divergent interests is wrong. Prosperity is a result of unrestricted (by government regulation) collaboration between both sets of individuals, employers and employees.

\f2\fs20 \cf0          The NHI is set to be South Africa's version of universal healthcare where resources are pooled in order to provide health services for everyone. Apart from the many flaws in the manner in which it is being implemented, a most serious flaw is that it is going to be prohibitively expensive. Scant attention has been paid in the South African public discourse to the structure of the proposed system and the problems inherent therein.\'a0  
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb60\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The NHI is a single-payer system where the government would be the sole purchaser of health services on behalf of all South Africans. The government would be responsible for certifying healthcare providers from both public and private providers. It is also envisioned that supply and demand-side measures would be implemented, presumably, to contain the economic effects that will arise from having zero prices on the demand side of the equation. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the absence of market prices, how likely are these "measures" to achieve their desired effects considering the expected behaviour of individuals on the demand side? And, how does this expected behaviour interact with the expected behaviour of South African voters in their role as provider of healthcare services by determining taxation through the political process? 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Public choice theory, a micro-economic analysis of actors in their public as well as private market roles, allows us the tools to make these kinds of analyses. Even a relatively simple (minimal assumptions) micro-economic model of behaviour applied to voters and market participants allows us to arrive at conclusions that accord closely with reality. That is because we do not limit ourselves to examining only economic market participants but also political market participants, who are often the same people. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In South Africa the bulk of taxes raised by government are in the form of PIT (Personal Income Taxes) and in the 2017/18 tax year 1.9 million South Africans contributed 80% of the revenue. Over the years PIT has grown from roughly making up the same proportion of revenue as VAT to becoming the single largest source of revenue. The reasons why are not difficult to see: VAT affects all voters, 80% of PIT is raised from less than 2 million South Africans out of almost 27 million registered voters. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This illustrates an important point with regard to South Africans as demanders of NHI services: At zero prices, the services offered by the NHI with the greatest elasticity of demand are going to experience the greatest demand from the public. In a country like the UK, one of the founders of public choice theory, James Buchanan, concluded that this increased demand for services in the NHS did not result in increased supply of the service because voters in their role as suppliers of the service through taxation had an incentive to keep taxes on themselves as low as possible. This mismatch lead to a deterioration in the quality of service offered by the UK's NHS. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The situation in South Africa is quite different given the fact that there is such a mismatch between the population of voters and the population of individuals paying taxes. This means that the marginal cost to the taxpayer of funding the NHI is likely to significantly outweigh the marginal utility derived from using the NHI. Those people paying taxes then have one of two options: they can either leave the country or stay and figure out a way of reducing their tax burdens. In other words, the voters will have an incentive to impose more and more taxes on the small population paying taxes in order to fund greater and greater levels of service, especially with regard to the NHI services that have the greatest elasticity of demand. The taxpayers will get to the point where the benefit of the NHI is outweighed by the cost because of this, and they will act rationally in an effort to reduce this burden. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The demand measures, e.g. gate-keeping, proposed by the health minister in the NHI policy are not worth the paper they are written on. As long as the tax system is structured as it is now, some political competitor to the government of the day will come along and propose reducing or eliminating any demand-limitation measures. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The point here is that there can be no social-solidarity without shared pain in the form of the tax burden. South Africa cannot have a system similar to the British NHS given the socio-economic state of the country where a tiny minority pay most of the taxes. Given that we are a democracy, such a situation leaves us vulnerable to the possibility of taxing the golden goose to death because any welfare measure is under the control of people who do not have to pay for it. With everyone acting rationally in the private as well as public arenas, the introduction of a system like the NHI will destroy the South African economy.
