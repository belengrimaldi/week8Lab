How to lead when you're not in charge

As the new CMO of a fast-growth direct-to-consumer apparel brand, Jen faced a conundrum. The Goldman Sachs-trained former investment banker was trying to bring data science and analytic rigor to a company that had captured the imaginations of millions of Americans through great design and hard work. Jen knew the next stage of growth would require a more analytical and data-based approach, but she faced resistance among the "instinct first" founders.  
If you've ever joined a team and tried to change it from the inside and without any real authority and mandate to do so, you can probably identify with Jen. In fact, at every stage of your career, and throughout life in general, we are all challenged to lead when we're not really in charge. This is the nature of human systems. And learning how to do this well is what separates those who surpass their peers and go on to lead their own business units or companies, from those who squander their potential as middle managers.
Most of us believe that "leaders" are people who occupy certain roles that come with some sort of official authority. The CEO is a leader. The president is a leader. The quarterback is a leader. We often believe leadership is bestowed upon someone by their role or title.
Yet, when we say people "rise to the occasion" or "take the lead," we are basically saying that people with no official authority sometimes go beyond what's expected of them and exercise leadership.
Leadership, then, is not at all about a role. It is actually the act of getting a group of people to do something that is in their best interest, or in the best interest of others, whether or not you have the authority to command those people to do what you want them to do.
At the end of the day, leadership when you are not in charge comes down to influence and persuasion. In our work with aspiring leaders like Jen, we've uncovered eight ways to exercise leadership when you're not in charge: 
Have the Courage to Act 
When utilized well, and alongside the other principles laid out below, having the courage to take the initiative is often rewarded with respect. Most people are deathly afraid of leading without authority, so when they see it done well, most often they admire it. 
Keep the Work at the Center
Harvard professor Ron Heifetz, the father of adaptive leadership, argues that the harder the problem you're trying to solve, the more people will want to distract themselves from the work at hand. This is why organizations working on hard problems have so much interpersonal politics. By keeping the work at the center, you encourage people to confront the problem, rather than get sucked into gossip and other distractions that keep real work from getting done.
Be Values-Driven and Be Obvious About It
It's really hard to argue with someone who is driven by a just and clearly communicated set of values. If you help your colleagues see that your interest in exercising leadership is driven by values, and not by self-interest, it is very hard to say no, unless of course they have conflicting values. In which case, you might want to seek other would-be followers.
Communicate the Big (and Little) Picture
Often, the right thing to do (which is most often the hard thing to do) seems isolated from a larger context. Sometimes everyone is so focused on the macro level, they can't see their ability to make a difference at the micro level right in front of them. Your ability to lead without authority will grow in proportion to your ability to communicate how small actions here and now have larger results over there sometime later.
Tap Into Their Sense of Purpose
Everyone has a purpose. But not everyone knows what theirs is. As a leader, you have an opportunity to help people tap into their own sense of purpose. Do you see an unused talent or expertise inside them? Do you see a new application of an old gift? Can you see a way for them to use themselves in a more meaningful way than they can see right now? If you can tap into their sense of purpose in a compelling way, you can help them direct that purpose and that energy to something extremely beautiful.
Tell a Compelling and Inspiring Story
People get committed to causes, but they first must be inspired by stories. Communicating your vision in a clear and compelling way paints a picture that people can see and feel. The more vivid the image, the more inspiring the story. But you also have to know your audience. Some people are inspired by morality and purpose. Others are inspired by feeling part of something. Still others are inspired by logic. Tell the story that motivates your particular audience.
Elevate Other Leaders
Sometimes the best ideas wither on the vine because people don't feel ownership or authorship. The best leaders without authority give away the credit for the idea and elevate others into championing the cause. When you put the work at the center as outlined above, you can detach from the idea of needing to be in the spotlight. Who cares who is seen as leading the charge if the most important thing is getting something done. This can also be called "make it their idea." 
Hold Steady
Another principle borrowed from the Heifetz adaptive leadership model, holding steady is all about patience. Often, we only get one chance to influence a group, and then we have to let it percolate around in the system for a bit before making another intervention. Try to intervene too much or too loudly, and you may become like one of those preachy people on the street no one listens to or takes seriously. Holding steady is about putting a great idea out there and letting people find it, own it, and then share it elsewhere on your behalf. And that's how you begin to build a movement.
Leading when you are not in charge is a delicate balance of influence and diplomacy. It requires a robust tool kit and thoughtful patience. Jen kept at it and developed dear personal relationships with her fellow C-Suite members. With a combination of the tools listed above, Jen has helped her leadership team embrace a more rigorous and data-driven approach to running the business. As a result, they continue to enjoy a market-leading role in the direct-to-consumer space while many of their peers have plateaued or lost market share. Jen has begun to master leading without authority to the benefit of the entire firm.

Data Science Reveals Why the Best Business Writers Avoid Certain Words. Turns Out Bestselling Authors Do, Too

Stephen King hates adverbs. And why, if the goal of writing is to get result, you should too.
Consider two sentences, one with an adverb and the other an active verb:
• "He closed the door firmly."
• "He slammed the door."
If you're Stephen King, you like the second and hate the first.
Because Stephen King hates adverbs.
"Adverbs," King claims in his classic book On Writing, "like the passive voice, seem to have been created with the timid writer in mind. ... with adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she isn't expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting the point or the picture across."
Makes sense. "Whispered" paints a more vivid picture than "spoke softly." "Sprinted" reads better than "ran quickly." Or "yelled" versus "hollered loudly." (Besides: Is there aother way to holler?)
But does King follow his own advice? Yep.
According to statistical analysis conducted on thousands of books by Ben Blatt in his book Nabokov's Favorite Word is Mauve: What the Numbers Reveal About the Classics, Bestsellers, and Our Own Writing, King's books -- along with long-time bestselling books by authors like Hemingway, Steinbeck, Tan, Dickens, and Austen -- contain relatively few adverbs.
That didn't just hold true for comparing certain authors to other authors; it also held true when comparing an individual author's novels. Critics tend to rate an author's books that use fewer adverbs per 10,000 words more highly than those by the same author that use more.
Granted, stripping all the adverbs from your writing won't instantly make -- or better yet, transform -- you into an amazing writer, much less a bestselling author. 
But if avoiding words that unnecessarily (oops again) modify verbs and writing in a more direct manner is good enough for some of the best authors of all time, that should be good enough for the rest of us.
Better calls to action. Better landing pages. Better promotional emails. Better content marketing. Bettter emails to employees, colleagues, etc. Good writing hooks a reader's attention and keeps it -- because good writing gets things done.
What else did Blatt's analysis uncover? 
• The best opening sentences tend to be short. (One of my favorites: "The afternoon my parents died, I was out shoplifting with Irene Klauson." Emily Danforth, The Miseducation of Cameron Post.)
• Male authors tend to use a lot more cliches than female authors. (Clearly mean need to start working smarter and harder.) (Double oops.)
• After a critically acclaimed first novel, 72 percent of authors publish a longer second book.
The last finding makes sense. If your first book is successful, that boosts your confidence. And your ego. People want to read what you write.
Which is also true for people in charge. You're the boss. You set direction. You have the answers.
Your employees are eager to read whatever you have to say. 
Actually, no. 
If the reader can't tell, right away, what you want -- to make or communicate a decision, to take certain actions, to respond by a certain time, or to simply feel complimented and appreciated -- then you failed.
Good writing makes a clear point. Good writing makes a meaningful point. 
Good writing gets things done.
The next time you write an email, think first about your goal: To educate, to instruct, to convince, to sell, to build a relationship, etc. (If you don't want to accomplish something, there's no reason to write.)
Determine exactly what you hope to accomplish; that drives everything.
Then stick to short sentences. Use action verbs instead of adverbs. Avoid cliches. When you finish a draft, try to cut it down by a third: The result will be more precise, more understandable, and more actionable for the reader.  As Mark Twain supposedly said, "I didn't have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long one."
In short, don't worry about being an artist. Be a technician.
Because results are all that matters. Whether an email, a report, a proposal... good writing is writing that gets things done.

Arianna Rosenbluth Dies at 93; Pioneering Figure in Data Science; Those We’ve Lost

Dr. Rosenbluth, who received her physics Ph.D. at 21, helped create an algorithm that has become a foundation of understanding huge quantities of data. She died of complications of the coronavirus.
The Metropolis algorithm, a technique for generating random samplings, started out as a way to understand a fundamental problem: how atoms rearrange themselves as solids melt.
Over the decades, the Metropolis algorithm and its subsequent variations have been put to a vast number of uses and now serve as an underpinning to understanding critical challenges of our age, including making sense of huge volumes of data, predicting election outcomes and understanding Covid-19’s spread.
A physicist who played an important role in developing that algorithm and thus shaping the science of simulation, Arianna Wright Rosenbluth, died on Dec. 28 at a nursing home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 93. The cause was complications of Covid-19, her daughter Jean Rosenbluth said.
Despite her extraordinary work and despite earning her Ph.D. from Harvard at 21, Dr. Rosenbluth left the field in her mid-20s and rarely talked about her scientific achievement afterward.
James Gubernatis, a physicist now retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said he called Dr. Rosenbluth in 2003 and asked for her recollections of the Metropolis algorithm’s development. “She really just wasn’t aware of the impact it’s had,” he said. “It was like, ‘Oh, that thing.’ She was surprised that anyone even remembered it.”
The Metropolis algorithm, which Dr. Rosenbluth programmed, is the basis of what today are called Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a mathematics of probability and statistics that provide simulations for complex problems that don’t have convenient solutions. These methods have been used in millions of applications, spreading well beyond physics to chemistry, biology and social science. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to economic and political forecasts as well as to modelings of Covid-19’s spread.
“It has earned a permanent place among the most important computer algorithms of all time,” said Adam Iaizzi, a physicist who dedicated his 2018 doctoral dissertation to Dr. Rosenbluth. “Almost 70 years later, it is still taught in every beginning computational physics course.”
Arianna Wright was born on Sept. 15, 1927, in Houston to Augustus and Leffie (Woods) Wright. Her mother was a schoolteacher, and her father was an office manager for a flower company.
Dr. Rosenbluth, an only child, was shy as a girl and a bookworm with a lifelong fascination with L. Frank Baum’s Oz series, her daughter said. She attended Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston on a full scholarship and received her bachelor’s degree in physics in 1946. She was 18.
Dr. Rosenbluth was an accomplished fencer, winning not only women’s championships but also men’s. But her plans to compete in the Olympics were foiled, first by the cancellation of the 1944 summer Games during World War II, then by a lack of funds for travel to the London Games in 1948, her daughter said.
She received her master’s degree in physics from Radcliffe College in 1947 and immediately began doctoral studies at Harvard.
At the time, female physicists were exceedingly rare, and not always welcomed into the fold. Her son, Alan, also a physicist, said that when his mother had set out to find a dissertation adviser, she originally approached the physicist Felix Bloch.
“He told her flat out, without malice, but just as a fact, that he wouldn’t take female Ph.D. students,” Dr. Rosenbluth said.
She eventually did her doctoral research under the supervision of John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. She received her Ph.D. in 1949, making her the fifth woman to earn a physics Ph.D. from Harvard since it began awarding them in 1873.
After completing her dissertation, she traveled west for a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, funded by the Atomic Energy Commission. There she met Marshall Rosenbluth, another physicist.
They married in 1951 and moved to New Mexico to work at Los Alamos. One colleague was Edward Teller, the famously fierce advocate of the hydrogen, or thermonuclear, bomb.
Dr. Rosenbluth honed her computing skills when she verified analytic calculations for the first full-scale test of a thermonuclear bomb, in 1952, code-named Ivy Mike. Separately, she and her husband then collaborated with Dr. Teller, his wife, the mathematician Augusta Teller, and the mathematical physicist Nicholas Metropolis to use random sampling to simulate a specific phenomenon in physics: the rearrangement of atoms when a solid melts.
The work resulted in the Metropolis algorithm. The group published its seminal paper, “Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines,” in The Journal of Chemical Physics in 1953.
Marshall Rosenbluth told an interviewer in 2003 that the group had discovered an entirely new approach to doing physics, thanks in large part to the advent of computers.
Arianna Rosenbluth’s contribution was crucial. “She actually did all the coding, which at that time was a new art for these new machines,” Marshall Rosenbluth said in 2003. Sophisticated programming tools were still years away, so Dr. Rosenbluth programmed in machine language, the strings of 1’s and 0’s a computer understands.
In 1956, the Rosenbluths moved to San Diego, where Marshall Rosenbluth took a job at General Atomics, a division of General Dynamics that had been established to explore peaceful uses of atomic energy. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1978.
In addition to her daughter Jean and her son, Alan, Dr. Rosenbluth’s survivors include two other daughters, Robin and Mary; five grandchildren; a step-grandchild; and two great-grandchildren.
After Los Alamos, Arianna Rosenbluth did not work professionally again, focusing instead on raising her children.
“This was someone at the start of an extraordinary career, really punching above anyone’s weight at the time,” said Benjamin Pope, a computational astrophysicist and lecturer at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
“So she makes a serious contribution to statistical physics and then she’s never heard from again,” said Dr. Pope, who created a Wikipedia page about Dr. Rosenbluth. “And today you couldn’t throw a rock down the street in Palo Alto or Berkeley without finding someone who’s running MCMC,” he added, referring to the technology-rich cities in California.
Still, Dr. Rosenbluth maintained her love of science.
“All while I was growing up, I remember her constantly working out equations just for her own mental exercise,” her daughter Jean, a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles, said. Alan Rosenbluth said his mother had pursued independent research in knot theory, a branch of mathematics.
Andrew Gelman, a statistician and political scientist at Columbia University, pointed out that many applications today use a program called Stan, which is based on a variant of the Metropolis algorithm. Dr. Gelman and his colleagues named the program after Stanislaw Ulam, a co-creator of the Monte Carlo methods.
“Maybe we should’ve called it Arianna,” he said.

Racism and Sexism Persist in Hiring Tech

Artificial intelligence used to evaluate job candidates must not become a tool that exacerbates discrimination.
American democracy depends on everyone having equal access to work. But in reality, people of color, women, those with disabilities and other marginalized groups experience unemployment or underemployment at disproportionately high rates, especially amid the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now the use of artificial intelligence technology for hiring may exacerbate those problems and further bake bias into the hiring process. 
  At the moment, the New York City Council is debating a proposed new law that would regulate automated tools used to evaluate job candidates and employees. If done right, the law could make a real difference in the city and have wide influence nationally: In the absence of federal regulation, states and cities have used models from other localities to regulate emerging technologies.
  Over the past few years, an increasing number of employers have started using artificial intelligence and other automated tools to speed up hiring, save money and screen job applicants without in-person interaction. These are all features that are increasingly attractive during the pandemic. These technologies include screeners that scan résumés for key words, games that claim to assess attributes such as generosity and appetite for risk, and even emotion analyzers that claim to read facial and vocal cues to predict if candidates will be engaged and team players.
  In most cases, vendors train these tools to analyze workers who are deemed successful by their employer and to measure whether job applicants have similar traits. This approach can worsen underrepresentation and social divides if, for example, Latino men or Black women are inadequately represented in the pool of employees. In another case, a résumé-screening tool could identify Ivy League schools on successful employees' résumés and then downgrade résumés from historically Black or women's colleges.
  In its current form, the council's bill would require vendors that sell automated assessment tools to audit them for bias and discrimination, checking whether, for example, a tool selects male candidates at a higher rate than female candidates. It would also require vendors to tell job applicants the characteristics the test claims to measure. This approach could be helpful: It would shed light on how job applicants are screened and force vendors to think critically about potential discriminatory effects. But for the law to have teeth, we recommend several important additional protections.
  The measure must require companies to publicly disclose what they find when they audit their tech for bias. Despite pressure to limit its scope, the City Council must ensure that the bill would address discrimination in all forms -- on the basis of not only race or gender but also disability, sexual orientation and other protected characteristics.
  These audits should consider the circumstances of people who are multiply marginalized -- for example, Black women, who may be discriminated against because they are both Black and women. Bias audits conducted by companies typically don't do this.
  The bill should also require validity testing, to ensure that the tools actually measure what they claim to, and it must make certain that they measure characteristics that are relevant for the job. Such testing would interrogate whether, for example, candidates' efforts to blow up a balloon in an online game really indicate their appetite for risk in the real world -- and whether risk-taking is necessary for the job. Mandatory validity testing would also eliminate bad actors whose hiring tools do arbitrary things like assess job applicants' personalities differently based on subtle changes in the background of their video interviews.
  In addition, the City Council must require vendors to tell candidates how they will be screened by an automated tool before the screening, so candidates know what to expect. People who are blind, for example, may not suspect that their video interview could score poorly if they fail to make eye contact with the camera. If they know what is being tested, they can engage with the employer to seek a fairer test. The proposed legislation currently before the City Council would require companies to alert candidates within 30 days if they have been evaluated using A.I., but only after they have taken the test.
  Finally, the bill must cover not only the sale of automated hiring tools in New York City but also their use. Without that stipulation, hiring-tool vendors could escape the obligations of this bill by simply locating sales outside the city. The council should close this loophole.
  With this bill, the city has the chance to combat new forms of employment discrimination and get closer to the ideal of what America stands for: making access to opportunity more equitable for all. Unemployed New Yorkers are watching.

Europe’s Vaccine Mess; The Morning Newsletter

New coronavirus cases are declining in countries with high vaccination rates. Then there is Europe.
It is the latest sign of the power of the Covid-19 vaccines: The number of new cases is declining, often sharply, in countries that have vaccinated a large share of residents.
That’s the situation in Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Britain. Cases are also declining in the U.S., which is not as far along as those three countries but is well ahead of most.
And on the other end of the spectrum is the European continent.
Across most of the European Union, vaccine rollout has been slow, and new cases are surging. Europe — the first place where the coronavirus caused widespread death — is facing the prospect of being one of the last places to emerge from its grip. My colleague Jason Horowitz writes from Rome: “Governments are putting exhausted populations under lockdown. Street protests are turning violent. A year after the virus began spreading in Europe, things feel unnervingly the same.”
As Eyck Freymann and Elettra Ardissino write in Foreign Policy: “Spring in the European Union is going to be dismal.” Bild, a German newspaper, recently ran the headline “Liebe Briten, We Beneiden You!” — a mixture of German and English that means “Dear Brits, We Envy You!” Wolfgang Münchau of Eurointelligence has said that Europe’s vaccination program rivals the continent’s budget austerity of recent years as “the E.U.’s worst policy error during my lifetime.”
Why has Europe done so poorly? There are three main reasons.
1. Too much bureaucracy
While the U.S. and other countries rushed to sign agreements with vaccine makers, the E.U. first tried to make sure all 27 of its member countries agreed on how to approach the negotiations. Europe chose “to prioritize process over speed and to put solidarity between E.U. countries ahead of giving individual governments more room to maneuver,” Jillian Deutsch and Sarah Wheaton write for Politico Europe.
The result was slower regulatory approval of the vaccines and delayed agreements to buy doses, forcing Europe to wait in line behind countries that moved faster.
2. Penny-wise and pound-foolish
Europe put a big emphasis on negotiating a low price for vaccine doses. Israeli officials, by contrast, were willing to pay a premium to receive doses quickly. Israel has paid around $25 per Pfizer dose, and the U.S. pays about $20 per dose. The E.U. pays from $15 to $19.
The discounted price became another reason that Europe had to wait in line behind other countries. Even in purely economic terms, the trade-off will probably be a bad one: Each $1 saved per vaccine dose might ultimately add up to $1 billion — a rounding error in a trading bloc with a nearly $20 trillion annual economic output. A single additional lockdown, like the one Italy announced this week, could wipe out any savings.
“The price difference is macroeconomically irrelevant,” Münchau writes. The E.U. “tried to lock in a perceived short-term price advantage at the expense of everything else.”
3. Vaccine skepticism
“Europe is the world’s epicenter of vaccine skepticism,” Deutsch and Wheaton of Politico Europe write. That skepticism predated Covid, and now its consequences are becoming clear.
In a survey published in the journal Nature Medicine, residents of 19 countries were asked if they would take a Covid vaccine that had been “proven safe and effective.” In China, 89 percent of people said yes. In the U.S., 75 percent did. The shares were lower across most of Europe: 68 percent in Germany, 65 percent in Sweden, 59 percent in France and 56 percent in Poland.
The skepticism helps explain Europe’s latest vaccination problem. About a dozen countries, including France and Germany, have suspended the use of one of the continent’s primary vaccines, from AstraZeneca, citing concerns about blood clots.
But the evidence that the vaccine causes clots is thin. Europe’s main drug regulator still says the benefits outweigh the risks. And Ann Taylor, AstraZeneca’s chief medical officer, has pointed out that the rate of clotting among vaccinated Europeans is lower than “would be expected among the general population.”
Dr. Muge Cevik, a virus expert at the University of St. Andrews, told me yesterday that it was always important to scrutinize vaccines. But, she added, “I would say the benefits of the A.Z. vaccine in preventing Covid, hospitalization and death outweigh the risks of side effects, especially in the middle of the pandemic.”
The bottom line: Over the summer, the U.S. was struggling more than any other country to contain Covid. Today, Europe appears to be in much worse shape.
THE LATEST NEWS
The Virus
• A year into the pandemic, here’s what public health experts wish the U.S. had done differently.
• The musicians of the Metropolitan Opera House have not been paid in almost a year. One cellist has sold his prized 19th-century bow.
U.S. News
• The authorities charged two men with attacking Officer Brian Sicknick with a chemical spray during the Capitol riot. Sicknick died the next day.
• Purdue Pharma is trying to end thousands of lawsuits over its role in the opioid crisis. The company presented a plan that would end the Sackler family’s control and would direct revenue toward abating the addiction epidemic.
• A prominent order of Catholic priests has pledged to raise $100 million to atone for the buying, selling and enslavement of Black people.
• The N.C.A.A. announced the bracket for its women’s basketball tournament, with Stanford as the top seed. (Here’s the printable bracket.)
• The Times Magazine tells one of the last untold stories of the Vietnam War — the scale at which the U.S. used Agent Orange in Laos, a neutral country.
Other Big Stories
• The largest dust storm in a decade swept across northern China, grounding flights and closing schools.
• Thousands of people across Australia protested violence and discrimination against women amid rape allegations against powerful men.
• The Vatican said that Catholic priests could not bless same-sex marriages, but that the church should welcome gay people “with respect and sensitivity.”
Opinions
A recent New Yorker essay by Jelani Cobb has spurred a debate: Is the Republican Party endangered?
• Yes, Cobb argues: Republicans are struggling to appeal to a demographically changing country and are split on key issues. Similar weaknesses eventually killed off the Federalists, the Whigs and other past U.S. political parties. (Cobb and Molly Jong-Fast went into more detail on “The New Abnormal.”)
• No, Jamelle Bouie of The Times replies: Unlike past parties, the G.O.P. is still able to win power without majority support because of its strength with rural and white voters. The Atlantic’s David A. Graham adds that today’s parties are more national, more polarized and better organized than their precursors, which will help stave off collapse.

More than a century of the Book Review
As The New York Times Book Review turns 125, you can comb through a timeline of some of the most significant moments in its history, including:
• In 1905, shortly before the publication of “The House of Mirth,” a portrait of Edith Wharton became the first photograph to appear on the section’s cover.
• In 1926, after A. A. Milne introduced the world to Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin, one young reader — Milne’s son, the original Christopher Robin — threatened “to take revenge upon his dad by writing poems about him.”
• In 1953, after the English publication of Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex,” which would go on to shape the modern women’s movement, the male reviewer called it “a truly magnificent book, even if sometimes irritating to a mere male.”
• In 1988, after “Beloved” did not win the National Book Award, the Book Review published a statement in Toni Morrison’s defense, signed by 48 Black writers.

How to design a plan to return to the office that works for introverts

Thanks to the pandemic, 50% of Americans are working remotely. Introverts are ecstatic. With less social interaction, more opportunities to quietly recharge, and space to focus on deep-thinking tasks, introverts are set to thrive.
As the vaccine slowly disperses, organizations are debating their return-to-office strategies. Introverts have anxiety over the impending change-and for good reason. Not only are modern, open office designs overwhelming for introverts, but extroverts are primarily in charge of the reentry plans. With 98% of top company executives and 88% of supervisors being extroverts, introverts are worried that their preferred, newfound work styles will be dismissed.
The evolution of an extrovert-friendly environment
In Susan Cain's New York Times bestseller, Quiet, she explains that the turn of the 20th century ushered in big businesses, city life, and a need for proving oneself in interviews and sales. Simultaneously, the film industry was growing exponentially, and charismatic movie stars were highly visible and strongly influencing our culture. All of these trends fit the extroverted ideal. But in this pandemic-induced remote work environment, we are starting to reevaluate whether our workplaces need to be hotbeds of socialization.
As explained by economist Tyler Cowen, introverts have traditionally been undervalued. Moreover, business travel and meetings (two extrovert-friendly domains) have been grossly overrated. He argues that "having the highest-productivity individuals in a company be free to do what they want, to have a Zoom call with the people they want; that's going to drive a lot of innovation and productivity growth."
Organizations' positions on who should return to the office post-pandemic are wide-ranging. For example, consulting firms seem more comfortable with work staying primarily remote. Alternatively, big-name companies like Microsoft have stated that associates must be present in an office 50% of the time or more, citing the need to balance business demands and culture-building with attracting talent. But for the most part, research suggests that employers are still determining what their ultimate work-from-home policy will look like.
Key considerations for a return to the office
It's important that organizational leaders conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of remote work options before reverting back to work environments that are geared toward extroverts. For example, some organizational leaders are choosing to keep remote work as an option simply because it saves money on office space. But there's also a soft-cost argument.
Employees are more engaged and committed when they can be their authentic selves and work in ways that align with their tendencies and preferences. For example, in a two-year study across 500 employees, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University found that compared to employees working face-to-face, employees opting to go remote were 50% less likely to leave the company and had a 24% productivity boost, primarily because they didn't have a commute and had far fewer interruptions.
Notwithstanding these benefits, connecting with others in person is at the core of the human experience, and not having that ability could cause some to feel lonely and isolated. Additionally, virtual interaction will never be a perfect substitute for face-to-face communication. For example, research illustrates that the richness of face-to-face communication makes it easier to develop a shared understanding of team and organizational objectives.
Regardless of where the organization settles-face-to-face, hybrid, remote, or a combination of these options-there are four things organizational leaders should be doing to address the long-silent concerns of their introverted employees.
Use assessments to take a pulse
Assess introversion-extroversion within your organization. Get data on where your employees fall on the scale, where they rank compared to their peers, and what their attitudes are toward remote versus in-person work. Just like organizations track and monitor surface-level diversity such as demographic differences, they should also be tracking deep-level diversity (such as traits, values, and preferences), because it can help facilitate feelings of inclusion and belonging.
Integrate training initiatives
Introverts prefer working one-on-one or in small groups, having agendas in advance of meetings, communicating over email, and having more time for deep-thinking tasks. They typically like to wait for a pause in conversation and speak up only when they have an idea that is necessary and novel.
Extroverts crave group settings and gain energy from being around others. They process their thoughts out loud and commonly perceive silence as awkward. The more we can understand each other's tendencies and preferences, the better chance we'll have of working more effectively together as team members.
Low-stimulation environments like private huddle rooms and quiet spaces are key for introverts to thrive. Open office floor plans are fine, but with a few tweaks. Employees who disappear into conference rooms when they need time alone to process and recharge shouldn't be judged or ostracized. Noise management is also a must. Cover the cost of headphones, especially if employees are seated near cafeterias, break rooms, or other common spaces.
Create a community for introverts
Introvert communities can help instill a sense of inclusion and belonging. Some companies have rolled out internal initiatives that allow introverts to share their perspectives in a more comfortable environment. These tailored groups give room for introverts to share and feel as recognized and acknowledged as their extrovert counterparts.
For example, 84.51°, where Meagan is a consultant, created a group called ITOPiA, a community that allows more reserved employees to feel more comfortable as well as create a space for extrovert managers to hear feedback on how to better communicate with introvert employees.
But first, start the conversation
After a year of social isolation, extroverts might be anxious to get everyone back together in the office, but they should do so with caution. A strong business case can be made for allowing employees, especially introverts, to work from home-including more quiet time and fewer distractions and drains to motivation. However, if you are in a manager role, you will still want to audit the effectiveness of long-term remote work for your more reserved employees, because for many introverts, their home is not an ideal workplace and video meetings can sap all their energy.
Whatever the remote work policy might be, there is still room for improvement in the inclusion of introverts. All organizational leaders should begin assessing introversion, incorporating introversion into development initiatives, creating an introvert-friendly environment, and establishing a community for introverts and extroverts to learn how to work better together. These are the types of considerations that everyone-regardless of their personality-should be talking about.

Meagan Connley is lead consultant at 84.51°, a data science and management consulting company owned by Kroger. She is one of the founding members and a current co-lead of ITOPiA, a community that focuses on balance between introvert and extrovert personalities.

UK-based data science and tech company Black Swan Data Ltd has secured 6.2 million pounds in Series B funding. The investors were Albion Ventures, Blackstone and Mitsui.
PRESS RELEASE
London 7th July 2016 – Black Swan Data Ltd., the UK’s leading data science and technology company, today announced that it has closed its Series B funding, raising a total of £6.2 million. The round sees Albion Ventures join initial institutional investors Blackstone and Mitsui, to help further accelerate Black Swan’s international growth and expansion of its product platform, ‘The Nest’.
Founded in 2011 by Steve King (CEO) and Hugo Amos (CSO), Black Swan has achieved outstanding growth based on its unique capability of applying big data and predictive data science techniques to consumer marketing. It works with many of the world’s leading consumer-focused brands including PepsiCo, Vodafone, Samsung, Disney and Panasonic, to help them think differently about data, technology, their customers and ultimately their own businesses. The company’s exceptional growth rate of 134% CAGR earned it first place in the Sunday Times Start Up Track 2015 and the company topped the 2016 Sunday Times Export Track 100, being the UK’s SME with the fastest growing international sales.
The additional funding will enable Black Swan to further accelerate the development of its proprietary software platform, ‘The Nest’, which provides deep customer insights by linking publicly available data to a customer’s private data, and complete the build out of its senior management team. It has recently made significant progress in this area with the appointment of Jeff Headley as US Managing Director, previously SVP Personalization at Dunnhumby and Simon Davies as Product Director, previously VP Product Management at DataSift.
The growth of Black Swan comes at a time when consumer interaction with technology continues to increase and evolve giving consumer brands the opportunity to gain a competitive edge by interpreting consumer data to make business changes. According to Gartner, 90% of all data was created in the last two years, 70% of organisations purchase external data and the market for ‘Advanced Analytical Service Providers’ is already worth $16bn. By 2018, over half of large organisations will compete using advanced analytics and proprietary algorithms.
Steve King, CEO and Co-Founder at Black Swan commented: “Black Swan’s seen some phenomenal growth over the last 18 months and this has been reflected in the conversations we’ve been having with investors and clients alike. At the start of the year, it was very straightforward to raise the amount we wanted from Blackstone and Mitsui, but there was an opportunity to add to the round with Albion Ventures to accelerate our plans further.”
Steve continued: “We’re at the forefront of this industry opportunity and we’re working with some of the world’s biggest brands to help them not only make sense of the data around them, but use to gain a competitive advantage and better engage with their audiences. It’s fantastic to have Albion Ventures join our corner, helping us to attract amazing talent like Jeff and Simon, develop and scale our technology quicker and move rapidly to capitalise on the market.”
Ed Lascelles, Partner at Albion Ventures says, “We are thrilled to partner Steve and Hugo through our investment in Black Swan. This is an exciting company, with an outstanding team and high profile customers in a high growth market. Businesses that leverage data intelligently will lead the way and Black Swan has the potential to become the leading provider of automated, predictive analytics to the digital marketing sector.”
Jun-ichi Shibuta, General Manager of IT Platform Div, IT & Communications Business Unit at Mitsui & Co., Ltd. commented: “Mitsui is investing in global business innovation across a variety of key business sectors. We believe that the trend towards predictive data analytics will affect all industries and the way they think about corporate strategy, so it’s logical that utilising big data will become increasingly more important to maintain and strengthen businesses, which is why we’ve collaborated with Black Swan.”
Headquartered in London, Black Swan services its international client base through offices in Bristol, Exeter, Hungary, Los Angeles, New York, Singapore, South Africa and Toronto and currently has over 240 full time employees.

Why this AI engineer is using sci-fi to unpack tech's biggest problems

S.B. Divya's new science fiction thriller, Machinehood, is set in a not-too-distant future when people have access to tabletop biotech labs that churn out everything from cures for new diseases to performance-enhancing drugs. But they find that taking such drugs is all but mandatory as they compete for paying gig work in an economy where more and more jobs can be done by artificial intelligence.
Before she was a published author, Divya was an engineer with a background in computational neuroscience and data science, as well as computing hardware and software. She talked to Fast Company about how her work has shaped her writing, the not-quite-dystopian world she envisions in Machinehood, and why she's still optimistic about the future.
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
How did your tech career inform your writing?
I actually started college intending to go into astrophysics, and after a couple of years I got sideswiped by a really interesting new department at Caltech at the time, which was computational neuroscience. That was kind of an interesting hybrid of physics, electrical engineering, and neurobiology. I found it really fascinating. I felt like the brain was as mysterious as the far reaches of our universe, which was surprising and intriguing. I ended up working in medical devices, and I was still able to put a lot of my machine-learning knowledge to use there in the applications of pattern recognition.
Then I went on to getting a master's degree in signal processing and high-speed communications, which led me to a couple of interesting jobs. I had a stint at a startup doing digital music fingerprinting, which was really fun. We were trying to take an MP3 file and match it up to identify what song it was, which is obviously an application that is in use today. At the time, we intended to use it as a plug-in for peer-to-peer services like Napster and Scour, which are totally gone and have been replaced by paid music.
Then, I went on to working in chip design, so the high-speed semiconductor industry. I was working on VDSL, and then Ethernet, and then I cycled back to very specifically machine learning with the rise of data science over the past few years. I switched from being more in the hardware side to purely back into the software domain.
And so I kind of had this hybrid background of blending biology and technology. My most recent job was using the Apple Watch to track people's sleep, and for that I was doing a lot of data crunching but also neural networks and pattern recognition. There are a lot of doctors and also molecular biologists and biochemists who are really enthusiastic about the idea of being able to tailor treatments for an individual's physiology and biochemistry.
Right now, treatment is often overkill, too broad. The ideal going forward is to be able to understand an individual's body biochemistry and how they're going to react to a drug or a particular therapy and then tailor that to their specific chemistry. I think we're going to have the tools to be able to do that over the next hundred years. So these are some of the things that have definitely informed my science fiction going back to the beginning.
My first book was a short novel or novella called Runtime, which involved a cybernetically enhanced adventure racer. For that I was drawing on some of the work I had seen done at Caltech that continues today, which is embedding chips in the human body that interface with your nerves, with your muscles, and with your brain. Right now they're being used therapeutically, but as with many things, that eventually turns to consumer products, so I had fun with that.
More recently for Machinehood, it's just loaded with fun biotechnology and personalized medicine and also complications that can arise from these kinds of things.
As far as the complications in Machinehood, you really dive into the regulatory failure around certain drugs and devices. Do you think that we'll have the right regulatory apparatus to make these things safe and effective before they're deployed in the real world?
I think we're facing a really interesting challenge when it comes to regulating all forms of technology, including biotechnology, and that is that we have regulatory apparatuses today but they are large and bureaucratic and they have a hard time keeping up with the pace of science and technological development, which is accelerating.
Even in Machinehood, I posit that there's this sort of cycle. There was a period of deregulation and acceleration of technology and then all the negative consequences of that, which led to increased regulation, and then another cycle again. I feel like we kind of go through that.
We've seen that very immediately with the pandemic and the vaccine, where we have had to use a loophole of emergency use authorization rather than going through the traditional FDA channels in America, because the traditional channels take years and years, and we can't afford to wait years and years.
It kind of begs the question, if we're considering this vaccine safe and effective, which it seems to be, then does it really count as emergency use or should this be the process going forward? Can we always do this? There are always people in dire need of new therapies who have to wait or who get an emergency or compassionate use special exemption. While there are many, many good reasons for this, including the fact that we don't want to harm people, the flip side is that the longer we take on the regulatory side, the more people are suffering while waiting for treatment.
It's a very tough balance to strike, and I think it's going to get touchier as we go forward unless we change the system to be able to respond faster to what's happening in the market.
What kind of changes do you envision would make that possible?
As with any large bureaucracy, the bigger a thing is, the slower it tends to move. We'll have to figure out a way to break it up. So the question is, how can we do that while still maintaining the need for safety and efficacy? That's always the goal: The drug or the biotechnology needs to be effective, and it needs to be safe.
I think much like with computers and something like AI, where we've seen the sort of leapfrogging of hardware and software where one catches up to another and then the other one accelerates-I think we're going to see that over the next decades with biotechnology as well. In this case, the leapfrogging is between the science and regulatory bodies, so we'll catch up to what we're able to do and then perhaps we hit a crisis point like the pandemic, which makes us reevaluate our systems and reconsider the timetables.
So probably for a while we will be able to keep pace, and then biological sciences will leapfrog again. For example, in Machinehood, I posit that we end up having tabletop genetics, taking a tool like CRISPR that allows gene editing. Like what happened with digital technology, where we started with computers that fill entire rooms and now we have computers that fit in our pockets: What if the same thing happens with biology and we have genetic engineering where you can produce something like a vaccine in your home office?
That would be a game changer. Similarly, as we get better at simulating biological systems, we'll be able to democratize the ability to study our own bodies to customize treatments, and then that's going create jobs, so more people will be able to enter this space and work in that particular field and that will also change the dynamic, right?
In the novel, you have a notion of people having to use this tabletop biotechnology and AI just to compete in the workforce. Do you think that's where we're headed?
I think we're there today. Imagine trying to conduct this interview if you didn't have a computer and an internet connection, or trying to do business without a smartphone. Trying to do school [remotely], there are a lot of kids who are struggling right now without a broadband connection or in a household where the only device available is the parent's phone.
So I think in a lot of ways, we've already arrived, and again, Machinehood is an extrapolation and acceleration in that same direction. But I think we're already there to the point where if you don't have access to the technology, you're not going to be able to compete in the workforce.
I don't know of anyone who isn't going to at the very least pay for a cellphone at this point. And most people would consider paying for a smartphone essential, and that's not a cheap bill. And if you're using it as part of work, it becomes an essential tool, but you're paying for it out of your wages.
We've gone from a primarily agrarian and farm-based labor force to an information-based one. And you have tractors and sprinklers and drones that spray pesticides and fertilizers. You don't have as many humans working the fields except for those few jobs like strawberry picking where we have struggled to develop the robots to do what human beings can do much easier and cheaper.
From that standpoint, I think some of the jobs and the bulk of the workforce in terms of what they're doing today, that is definitely going to change 100 years from now. People are not necessarily going to be sitting in front of their computers working on spreadsheets and conducting meetings.
Not so dystopian
At the end of the day, are you optimistic about the future? That we'll get things right and turn around some of the problems that we're facing?
I'm generally pretty optimistic about the future. I think there are always oscillations like I said, two steps forward, one step back, and [some people] will react negatively to it and they'll want to pull society back from those changes. But overall, looking at the long arm of history, we have always marched, on average, on that long arc in the direction of greater equality, of progress, of better quality of life, longer life.
I think it's interesting that in both Runtime and Machinehood's early reviews, people call those stories or worlds that I've invented dystopias. Because I don't think of them as dystopic views of the future. The way I see it, there are always going to be problems. We're just going to be facing different problems.
The future's going to bring a different set of challenges, but hopefully a lot of the problems we're facing today, we're going to start to face and overcome. Any time that we make progress, anything new that shows up is going to introduce new concerns, just like the internet has introduced the digital divide. In some ways it's a carry forward of the same problem of the haves and the have-nots.
That kind of thing, that fundamental human nature, I think is going to be very hard to make go away. Just because we are who we are, until or unless we start deeply tinkering with our own biology and our hormones and our brain structures. At which point you could argue we're not human anymore.
Until we get there, human beings are gonna human. We're gonna fight about all the old things. There's still going to be greed, there's still going to be lust. But I think overall, we will hopefully be healthier, we will have a wider reach for education, for food, for all the things that we really need, and for equality-for gender equality, for able-bodied and disabled people, for people of color, for people throughout the globe.
Overall, I'm optimistic that progress will still march forward, whether people like it or not. We'll hit some bumps along the way but we'll get over them.

With the addition of Statwing’s technology to the Qualtrics platform, any user will be able to dive deep into actionable data without having to spend hours performing cumbersome analysis in systems like R, SPSS, or Microsoft Excel. Even more importantly, organizations that previously weren’t able to discover predictive insights now can.
The deal comes as Qualtrics, a pre-IPO company that is one of the few cashflow positive unicorns, continues to put a new face on the multi-billion dollar customer experience management industry. Up to this point, all Qualtrics growth has been organic. This is the first of many acquisitions for the company.
“We’re thrilled to be joining the Qualtrics team and to see our technology integrated with the amazing platform Qualtrics has already created,” said Greg Laughlin, cofounder and CEO of Statwing. “Statwing makes it easier than ever to turn data into predictive insights. By joining Qualtrics, we are creating a new world where you don’t need to be a statistician to know who the next three customers are that plan to leave your business or to know what levers you need to pull to keep them.”

Even as Cases Drop, A Contagious Variant Is Gaining Ground

As U.S. coronavirus cases remain at a low not seen since October, a more contagious variant first reported in the United Kingdom has likely grown to account for more than 20 percent of new U.S. cases as of this week, according to an analysis of data from Helix, a lab testing company.
There is not yet enough genomic sequencing -- the process required to screen positive coronavirus samples for variants -- to be certain of how widely that variant, known as B.1.1.7, is spreading. But data suggests its share of total cases is growing at a trajectory similar to that seen in countries where it has fueled surges. 
  Still, experts note that low total case counts in states with a high share of B.1.1.7 are an encouraging sign. It remains to be seen, they say, whether the variant will cause a significant resurgence here or whether widespread vaccinations and virus-control measures can keep case counts at bay.
  The B.1.1.7 variant is just one variant of concern found in the United States, in addition to a variant first identified in Brazil and another discovered in South Africa. But those variants make up a tiny fraction of total cases compared with B.1.1.7, which experts say is likely to become dominant across the country this month. The variant is doubling as a share of all new U.S. cases approximately every 10 days, continuing a pattern first identified by researchers in early February.
  Screening for variants requires sending a positive sample to a lab to be sequenced, which takes time and resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it often takes about 10 days to sequence a sample and analyze it for reporting. Estimates for the cost of sequencing a sample range from $25 to $400, according to a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. And the large amount of data each sequence generates requires computational and data science expertise that many health departments struggle to afford.
  Only 0.5 percent of cumulative cases in the country have been sequenced since the beginning of the pandemic, but, with new efforts, about 1 percent of new cases in February and about 3 percent in the past two weeks were sequenced, according to C.D.C. data and Jasmine Reed, a spokeswoman for the agency.
  Experts' recommendations on how many cases should be sequenced vary, but many say sequencing around 5 percent of cases would begin to adequately show the spread of variants circulating at low levels.
  The United Kingdom, by contrast, has sequenced about 8 percent of its total cases and is currently doing so for about a third of its cases, according to its health secretary. It has about as many new cases per day as Florida. Denmark, another world leader in coronavirus genomic surveillance, had sequenced about 12 percent of its total cases as of January. It now sequences almost all new positive cases, which are now at daily levels comparable to Mississippi or Missouri.
  The share of cumulative cases sequenced varies widely by state, from as high as 3.5 percent in Hawaii to 0.05 percent in Tennessee. Some states have had an advantage: It's easier to sequence a higher share of cases if the total number of cases is lower. But those vast differences in genomic surveillance mean it is especially difficult to estimate how widely a given variant is spreading in states where there are not many cases being monitored.
  According to estimates based on the Helix data, there were most likely tens of thousands of cases attributed to B.1.1.7 in the United States in the past week alone. But because sequencing is so low, only 2,672 cases have been officially recorded.
  Helix has analyzed nearly half a million positive samples for an anomaly indicative of the B.1.1.7 variant. Helix then sent samples to Illumina, a gene-sequencing company, to have their genomes sequenced to confirm the variant. Based on results from those samples and the share of cases with the anomaly, Helix is able to make inferences about how widely B.1.1.7 might be spreading.
  The relative share of the variant grew exponentially over the past several weeks in almost every state where Helix had enough data for a trend to be evident. In Florida, the share of cases caused by the B.1.1.7 variant was highest: well over an estimated 30 percent of cases. Nationwide, the figure is probably more than 20 percent, though Helix's testing is not representative of population distribution.
  But there could be some good news: Even Florida, where the variant is spreading most widely as a share of total cases, has not yet seen a resurgence in total new coronavirus cases.
  ''I am encouraged by the declining case counts in the most heavily affected states,'' said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. ''I've been watching Florida closely, which has the highest share of B.1.1.7. Case counts have plateaued there in recent days but are not resurging. The longer we can hold the line, the more time we have to roll out vaccines, which will protect individuals, particularly those at highest risk of severe illness, and slow transmission over all.''
  B.1.1.7 is not the only variant of concern in the United States, but it has by far the biggest foothold. According to the C.D.C., which is tracking confirmed cases of the variants, there are more than 30 times as many cases of B.1.1.7 as of the other two variants of concern first reported in South Africa (called B.1.351) and Brazil (called P.1). So far, those other two have been found in a minority of states, but given the low rate of sequencing in many states, they are most likely spreading undetected in others.
  ''The other variants are circulating at very low levels now compared to B.1.1.7, but over the long run it will be important to watch those because they have the potential to make our vaccines less effective,'' Dr. Rivers said.
  ''Although total cases have been going down in recent weeks, B.1.1.7 cases have not, which means that it may not be surprising to see cases start rising again in regions that have high levels of B.1.1.7 transmission,'' said William Lee, vice president of science at Helix.
  But even if another resurgence in cases begins, Dr. Lee says it is reasonable to hope the situation would be different than when the United Kingdom faced a sharp spike around the holidays. ''I think even if cases start going up again, the impact on hospitalizations and mortality may still be mitigated by vaccinations and higher levels of natural immunity than we had in the past.''

Program Seeks to Nurture 'Data Science Culture' at Universities

Highlight: A new partnership is intended to foster the sharing of data analysis ideas and methods across different academic disciplines.

The modern flood of data comes in a many forms - sensor data, genomic data, web click streams and credit card transactions, to name a few. The disparate data sources are often called "silos," suggesting the challenge of mingling different data sets to generate insights.
But if the data is in a silo, so are the people, often isolated in their fields of expertise. In universities, that problem is a key obstacle to progress in data science, according to academic research scientists. 
And that problem, among others, is the focus of a new five-year project, involving three universities and supported by $37.8 million in funding from the Moore Foundation and the Sloan Foundation.  The three universities in the partnership are New York University, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley. The program is being announced today in Washington at an event organized by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to highlight initiatives being taken by government, industry and academia to advance data-driven scientific discovery and technological progress.
Yet the program comes at a time when universities across the country - on their own - are opening up data science centers and institutes. These academic start-ups typically marry professors and graduate students from computer science, statistics and applied mathematics with those from other departments including biology, medicine, economics and even journalism.
So what is the need for the foundation-backed program? Most of the university data-science programs, the foundation sponsors say, are focused on projects and adapting data-analysis techniques to specific disciplines. "What this partnership is trying to do is change the culture of universities to create a data science culture," said Joshua Greenberg, director of the Sloan Foundation's Digital Information Technology program.
Yann LeCun, a computer scientist, is the director of New York University's new Center for Data Science. But he sees the three-university collaboration as a program with a different agenda. "This is not so much to do science, but to organize yourself to create a new discipline, an environment, a data science environment," Professor LeCun said.
At each university, 12 to 15 professors will be the core participants representing the life, environmental, physical and social sciences. Each campus will also have a "data science studio," staffed by data scientists and software professionals, where people from different disciplines will share ideas and techniques.
The partnership, according to Chris Mentzel, who heads the Moore Foundation's Data-Driven Discovery initiative, is intended to be a demonstration project that other universities will emulate. A culture to accelerate data science, he noted, should produce results. "If we can show that great science comes out of this, it can't be ignored," Mr. Mentzel said.
Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington, believes that data and data science will become a common ground and common language across disciplines - "the great unifier of the next decade or two" in universities, he said.
Part of the common ground - and an objective of the partnership - is to create software tools for data handling and analysis that can be widely shared. Pursuing that goal, the professors say, will require creating new, long-term career paths for the data scientists that develop such tools.
That would mark a significant improvement from the current situation, where "everything you do is start from scratch," said Saul Perlmutter, an astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Nobel prizewinner. 
On many projects, Professor Perlmutter said, important software is written by "some poor, struggling graduate student" who writes clever code, but then must go off to publish papers if her or she is to earn a doctorate. Standard software development practices, like documentation and testing, tend to fall by the wayside.
Recognized career paths - and status - for data scientists are needed if universities are going to compete. In their joint proposal to the foundations in August, the project leaders for the three universities wrote, "Universities are losing much of the top data science talent they produce to industry. We need them back at the universities, working on the world's most important science problems - not trying to make people click on ads."

A Data-Science Lender Takes on Student Debt

Highlight: Earnest, a start-up lender, is moving into the student debt market. Using data-science tools, Earnest says it can offer lower, tailored rates and flexible repayment schedules. 


Body


Louis Beryl insists that financially responsible young people are the borrowers most disadvantaged by the traditional math of consumer lending. The standard scoring of creditworthiness relies largely on a person's credit history, and that's a blunt instrument. Since young people have slender credit histories, he said, they pay higher rates than they should.
Mr. Beryl is betting that he and his team at Earnest, a San Francisco start-up, can do better. Earnest is one of a new breed of lenders bringing the tools of data science - the modern flood of data and clever software - to consumer finance, which I wrote about in an article last week.  Their approach is a digital-age spin on the most basic principle of banking: Know your customer.
Earnest, founded in 2013, began lending last year with general consumer loans. They are typically for a few thousand dollars, though they can range up to $30,000. Many of the loans are for relocation expenses and  professional training. Most of Earnest's borrowers are college graduates, aged 22 to 34.
So it is scarcely surprising that the next market for Earnest will be student debt, introducing on Tuesday a refinancing product for student loans. The start-up also announced on Tuesday that it closed a $17 million Series A round of venture investment, led by Maveron. To date, Earnest has raised $32 million including debt financing. Its venture capital investors include Maveron, Andreessen Horowitz and Atlas Venture.
Other data-science lenders plan to offer education loans. Affirm, another start-up in San Francisco, will soon start making loans for so-called accelerated learning programs, said Brad Selby, vice president of business development. These short, intensive courses are designed to teach skills like computer programming and data science that improve a person's job prospects, and thus ability to repay a loan.
Interest rates on Earnest's student loan refinancing product can be as low as 1.92 percent, the company says. But another advantage is that Earnest's personalized underwriting allows for tailored rates and gives borrowers considerable flexibility. A borrower can to go the company's website and change the repayment rate and term of the loan, and the site instantly recalculates the borrower's total cost over the life of the loan.
With more than $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt in America, Earnest is certainly entering a large market, and making repayment cheaper and easier would have an economic and social payoff.
"Student loans are our generation's first homes," said Mr. Beryl, the 34-year-old co-founder and chief executive of Earnest. And he still holds $100,000 in student debt himself, a legacy of attending pricey if prestigious schools - Princeton, the Harvard Business School and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
All the new data-driven lenders tap many different sources of information, and they are all constantly experimenting with new combinations of data and fine-tuning their predictive software. The loan approval process can be completely automated or require a human nod at the end.
For Earnest, the student loan refinancing product will rely on the system used for its consumer loans.
Earnest asks its borrowers for a lot of information. It wants to see their bank accounts, credit-card statements, student loan and any other loan balances. It also wants to see any investment accounts or retirement accounts. It asks loan candidates to make sure their LinkedIn accounts of job and education history are filled in and up to date.
This is all done without paperwork. Earnest expects its borrowers to conduct their financial lives online. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest's software algorithms give weight to things not factored into traditional credit analysis like education and savings, which, in the start-up's calculations, point to capacity to pay and lower risk.
 "Our clients are giving us access to their data," Mr. Beryl said, "so we can dig into the details of their life."
Autumn Carter, 26, borrowed $3,000 from Earnest in September, to furnish and decorate a new apartment in Mountain View, Calif. She wanted a loan quickly and conveniently, so she looked for alternatives to traditional banks or credit unions. Ms. Carter went online, searched and noticed a reference to Earnest and its "merit-based loans" with low interest rates. "At first, I thought it was a scam," she recalled.
 But Ms. Carter proceeded to do some online research and saw favorable reviews, saying the loan process was smooth and the customer service helpful. She went to the Earnest website, and filled out the loan application in 10 minutes or so. The information she passed on included that she graduated from Stanford in 2011, and has under $10,000 in student loans outstanding; she was once rejected for a loan for lack of a credit history; and she makes a salary of about $55,000 as the executive director of California Common Sense, a public policy research group.
Ms. Carter's non-profit research organization focuses on data-driven policy analysis. She handed over her personal information without hesitation, and she finds Earnest's data-gathering and analysis for determining credit risk to be "fascinating."
Within a day, Ms. Carter received an email approving her three-year loan with an annual interest rate of about 5 percent, a calculation based on her data. She plans to pay off the loan early, and there are no prepayment penalties on Earnest loans. 
At Earnest, smart software is its animating engine, but at this stage two or more people in the company review the predictive recommendations of the algorithms - and they make the final call. Fewer people may be needed as the software gets better. "But we think the human element," Mr. Beryl said, "will always be an important piece in our process to make sure we are getting it right."

Culver City, California-based data startup DataScience Inc has raised $22 million in funding. The company’s backers include Whitehart Ventures and Greycroft Partners.
PRESS RELEASE
CULVER CITY, Calif. — December 10, 2015 – DataScience, Inc. (datascience.com) has closed $22 million in funding this week. The investment, led by Whitehart Ventures, extends the $4.5 million Series A financing round led by Greycroft Partners, bringing DataScience’s total amount of funding to more than $28 million.
The new funding round will be used to grow DataScience’s team of leading data scientists and engineers who combine intellect, proprietary in-house tools, and data to drive significant business results.
“The current practices for extracting and communicating insights from data are broken,” said Ian Swanson, co-founder and CEO of DataScience. “Existing business intelligence and analytical software tools are focused on visualizing every single way you can slice data, which fails to give users a direct and precise course of action.”
“Many of these tools output a barrage of key performance indicators, which are scattered in different emails, PDF reports, and dashboard visualizations. This results in wasted time and effort in trying to figure out where to focus to make impactful decisions,” Swanson added. “We designed DataScience to show customers precisely what they need to know to answer their toughest questions and to collaborate on those insights so they can quickly be put into action.”
How DataScience Works:
The process begins when customers send data securely to DataScience either in real-time or as flat files. Actionable insights are extracted from the data through the use of proprietary technologies, a network of custom models, and an in-house team of data scientists. DataScience looks at predictive factors such as lifetime value, churn, and likelihood of sale, in addition to particular needs expressed by the customer (e.g. How can I improve discounting efficiency?). All of the resulting insights are published on the DataScience web application, which provides users with a host of interactive tools including categorization, advanced search, and other collaborative functions for individuals and business teams.
One of DataScience’s text mining models was tooled to evaluate online reviews for common words or phrases found in the lowest reviews of a particular product. The model noticed that “shipping” and “poor description” were found commonly among very negative reviews — and shared the insight with the customer via DataScience’s web application. The customer’s product and marketing teams then focused on improving the shipping process and bolstering the product descriptions on their online pages, resulting in a 20% decrease in negative customer reviews and a 15% increase in net promoter score.
Growing a Data Science Company & Culture:
“The demand for data science capabilities is booming across industries, and we’ve designed a product that leverages an ideal mix of human intellect and machine-powered analysis to serve that need,” Swanson said. “Whether our customers have in-house data scientists or not, we’re able to onboard in a matter of days, and quickly scale to deliver value across all of their business units, from marketing to customer support. Within months of service, many of our customers are seeing multi-million dollar revenue opportunities, and/or double digit improvements in their key metrics.”
In just six short months since announcing the company publicly, DataScience has signed on innovative corporations across a range of industries; from social applications like Tinder, to consumer electronics companies like Belkin.
DataScience isn’t just attracting top customers, but top talent as well. Whereas many companies are having trouble hiring data scientists, DataScience is pulling talent from a pool of over 1,000 applicants a month. “It’s a true testament to the culture we’ve built here, and our dedication to the growth of our employees and to the data science field,” Swanson said. DataScience was recently ranked the No. 1 Small Employer among the Top 100 Best Places to Work in Los Angeles in 2015 by the *Los Angeles Business Journal. *
About DataScience:
Based in Culver City, Calif., DataScience, Inc. combines human intellect with machine-powered analysis to extract information from data that drives real business results. Founded by a team of accomplished entrepreneurs with backgrounds in data science and big data, and experience in such Fortune 500 mainstays as American Express, AOL and Sprint, DataScience traces its lineage to Sometrics, which was acquired by American Express in 2011.

But the sprawling development on Manhattan's West Side, built on top of old rail yards along the Hudson River, will also become an urban laboratory for data science. The developers, Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, are teaming up with            New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progressto create a "quantified community."
The people aren't there yet; the first office tower is scheduled to open next year, and the first residential building in 2017. But the plan is extraordinary in its size and comprehensive approach, built in from the outset. Among the things expected to be measured and modeled: pedestrian flows, street traffic, air quality, energy use, waste disposal, recycling, and health and activity levels of workers and residents.
Privacy issues, of course, loom over the program. Researchers at N.Y.U. insist that any individual measuring, in homes or using smartphones, will require participants to choose to join, or opt in. And information collected for research or to make community services more efficient, they say, will be made anonymous, so people cannot be identified personally.
Yet the conditions under which people will feel comfortable sharing their personal information, the researchers say, will be another subject for experiment in the living laboratory of the Hudson Yards community.
The Hudson Yards collaboration is evidence of the potential for the emerging field of "urban informatics." It is a field fueled by the advance of digital technologies - sensors, wireless communication, storage and clever software - that make it possible to see and measure activities in an urban environment as never before.
There are dozens of research programs at universities worldwide seeking to use data science to better understand urban settings and behavior. The N.Y.U. centeris at the forefront. It has links with several universities, and is supported by corporations including            I.B.M.,            Microsoft,            Xerox and            Cisco, which are pursuing business in the "smart cities" market.
Cities around the world are using data collection and analysis tools to manage traffic, curb crime and conserve electricity and water. But most of the programs, experts say, are efforts to address one goal or another, and are being added to the existing infrastructure in old cities.
Hudson Yards will be different. "To start from scratch and to put all these technologies together in an integrated way is a neat opportunity, and an exciting thing to do," said Charlie Catlett, director of the Urban Center for Computation and Data, a joint initiative of the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.
The N.Y.U. researchers see the promise of Hudson Yards as a green-field "experimental platform," said Constantine E. Kontokosta, deputy director of the urban center. The researchers first met with the developers more than a year ago.
The developers were receptive to being able to tap the knowledge of data experts. "We're a real estate company," noted Jay Cross, president of Related Hudson Yards. The N.Y.U. researchers, Mr. Cross said, will collect and analyze the data, and his management team will use those insights to make Hudson Yards more efficient and a better living environment.
For example, detailed measurement of energy use in a building or office, Mr. Cross said, could point to steps to reduce electricity consumption by following the practice of a comparable space with lower electrical bills. And an individual, he said, might get a smartphone alert that a jazz combo, fashion show or street theater performance is starting soon in a nearby public plaza.
"I don't know what the applications might be," Mr. Cross added. "But I do know that you can't do it without the data."
As a new development, Hudson Yards will have some real data-gathering advantages. Every apartment, Mr. Cross said, will have a smart thermostat, like those made by Nest, the start-up that Google recently bought for $3.2 billion. "You can't get that from any old business in town," he said.
The N.Y.U. researchers see an opportunity to take a quantitative, comprehensive look at a community, run experiments, and make discoveries. Dr. Kontokosta observed that the concept of "sustainability" has been narrowly defined, mostly focused on water and energy consumption so far. "Sustainability has really been a measurement problem,"he said.
But with a broader array of measurements in a community, he said, a far wider range of observations becomes possible. An example, Dr. Kontokosta said, might be measuring noise, air quality or social interactions, and seeing how those correlate with educational achievement.
Combining measurements of the environment, physical systems and human behavior, said Steven E. Koonin, director of the N.Y.U. center, will open the door to understanding and modeling communities in new ways. "The real gold will be in combining the data science and the social sciences," Dr. Koonin said.
One result, he said, will be to change traditional disciplines. Civil engineering, he said, has traditionally centered on physical systems rather than human behavior. In the future, Dr. Koonin said, there may be careers in "human-centered civil engineering" or "civic engineering." Architects and interior designers, he said, study how people interact with buildings and rooms, but without much quantitative information. "Quantitative design," he said, may be a career of the future.
"Disciplines will merge," Dr. Koonin predicted, "as a result of the data."

Highlight: The period of inflated expectations for big data is giving way to steady investment in technology and people, whose pay is rising.

The outlook for data scientists: less hype, more hiring. 
The exuberance surrounding big data has passed its peak and is trending down, Gartner declared last August in its annual "hype cycle" reporton perceptions of technology.  
Perhaps, but it remains a rising market for data scientists.  Salaries rose 8 percent on average in the last year, with bonuses adding $56,000, according to a salary and employment survey released on Tuesday byBurtch Works, a recruiter of professionals with quantitative skills. 
The median base salary for entry-level data scientists was $91,000 nationally and $110,000 in Silicon Valley, the survey found. For experienced data scientists, leading teams of 10 or more, salaries are up to $250,000. The report was based on telephone interviews with 371 data scientists
The survey also points to a shift in demand for data scientists. The share of workers with deep data skills who are employed by start-ups fell by more than half, from 29 percent last year to 14 percent this year. Linda Burtch, managing director of the recruiting firm that bears her name, said the change reflected how much companies in mainstream industries like retailing, consumer products, insurance, health care and manufacturing were building up data science capabilities. 
The appeal for data scientists, Ms. Burtch said, is "you get to work on really good problems, and these established companies can offer them a decent work-life balance."
Khalid Ahmed, 25, is finishing up his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. His field of computational physics and materials science, Mr. Ahmed said, has increasingly become a data science - and he has veered in that direction. He was recruited by several companies including start-ups. One analyzed credit card data to target marketing and advertising campaigns. Instead, Mr. Ahmed chose to join Ford Motor as a data engineer in its hybrid car program.
With start-ups, Mr. Ahmed explained, the work often involves producing data-derived knowledge that is then sold to a larger company. But at a large manufacturer like Ford, he said, "I'll be influencing the design of the product itself."
In Charlotte, N.C., Ahmer Inam, 39, recently left Sonic Automotive, a large auto retailer with 100 dealerships in 14 states, where he was director of predictive analytics. He enjoyed the work, but ultimately he decided he wanted to move beyond tailored marketing. "Our work was designed to seduce a customer toward a particular vehicle and determine the optimal price," he said.
When he decided to leave, Mr. Inam had several offers from traditional companies and start-ups, and he chose the consulting firm  PricewaterhouseCoopers, which he joined last month. Mr. Inam was attracted by the prospect of working in a variety of industries and the opportunity to prod organizations to adopt the tools and methods of data science. The consulting firm, he said, also encourages its  professionals to use their skills on nonprofit community projects. At PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr. Inam said, "I can have a work-life balance that allows me to engage in analytics for social good initiatives."
There is an apparent contradiction between the buoyant job market for big data practitioners and Gartner's judgment that, on the perception scale, big data has moved  from high expectations to what Gartner calls the "trough of disillusionment." But, in fact, it fits a familiar pattern of technology absorption and use. Significant new technologies always take time to move into the mainstream as people and organizations learn to exploit them. It takes years. 
Theclassic study of the phenomenon, "The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox," by Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990. In it, Mr. David noted, the electric motor was introduced in the early 1880s, but its real payoff in productivity was not evident until the 1920s. It took that long for businesses to reorganize work around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough of its day, made possible by the electric motor. 
Similarly, it took a while for personal computers and the Internet to deliver big gains. And so too for big data, which harnesses computing, modern digital data and the software tools of artificial intelligence.
A report this week from Forrester Research described the challenge ahead. "Businesses are drowning in data but starving for insights," the report began. "Worse, they have no systematic way to turn data into action."
The Gartner hype cycle acknowledges that enthusiasm precedes  mainstream money-making. The graphic representation of the cycle looks like an exaggerated, lazy wave. After the disillusion phase comes the "slope of enlightenment" and then the "plateau of productivity." As Merv Adrian, an analyst at Gartner, put it, "If you want to see the revenue side of the hype cycle, you basically just flip it."

Looking to the Future of Data Science

Highlight: The future of data science lies beyond the big-data focus on predictions and recommendations, according to Oren Etzioni, a leading computer scientist. 


Body


TheAssociation for Computing Machinery, a leading professional association in computer science, is holding its annual conference this week, focusing on what we're now calling data science - though the ACM still clings to the label adopted when the yearly gatherings began in 1998,            Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. Of course, the field is booming, so the four-day conclave of talks, technical papers and human networking in New York has attracted an estimated 2,200 attendees, double last year's headcount. 
But in his keynote speech on Monday, Oren Etzioni, a prominent computer scientist and chief executive of the recently createdAllen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, delivered a call to arms to the assembled data mavens. Don't be overly influenced, Mr. Etzioni warned, by the "big data tidal wave," with its emphasis on mining large data sets for correlations, inferences and predictions. The big data approach, he said during his talk and in an interview later, is brimming with short-term commercial opportunity, but he said scientists should set their sights further. "It might be fine if you want to target ads and generate product recommendations," he said, "but it's not common sense knowledge."
In his presentation, Mr. Etzioni acknowledged the gains made possible by big data methods - identifying patterns and calculating statistical probabilities - in tasks like speech recognition and computer vision. But he then proceeded to underline the limits of the big data approach. He showed the results when one types in "apple fruit" into Google and the Knowledge Graph result, the extracted facts that Google presents as a graphic, is mainly a list of nutritional elements of an an apple. The results from other services that assemble knowledge bases, Bing and Wolfram Alpha, were similar.
But things that are readily understood by humans - that apples taste sweet and have a crunchy texture in the mouth when chewed, for example - are a challenge for the algorithms that generate digital databases.
 "Current knowledge bases are full of facts," Mr. Etzioni observed, "but they are surprisingly knowledge poor."
The "big" in big data tends to get all the attention, Mr. Etzioni said, but thorny problems often reside in a seemingly simple sentence or two. He showed the sentence: "The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam." He asked, What was made of Styrofoam? The large ball? Or the table? The table, humans will invariably answer. But the question is a conundrum for a software program, Mr. Etzioni explained, because the correct answer involves both grammar and background knowledge. And the latter is something humans acquire through experience of the world.
Computers can't experience the world as humans do. And Mr. Etzioni is skeptical of the progress that will be possible with "deep learning," an artificial intelligence technique that uses the structure of the human brain as metaphorical inspiration for computer systems that process huge amounts of data.
Instead, at the Allen Institute, financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Mr. Etzioni is leading a growing team of 30 researchers that is working on systems that move from data to knowledge to theories, and then can reason. The test, he said, is: "Does it combine things it knows to draw conclusions?" This is the step from correlation, probabilities and prediction to a computer system that can understand, in its way. That seems a steep climb of the semantic ladder of meaning. "We are trying to build these semantic models," Mr. Etzioni noted. 
Mr. Etzioni's presentation was titled, "The Battle for the Future of Data Mining." But other computer scientists see the big data approach and the quest for understanding described by Mr. Etzioni as less a battle than different yet complementary paths, heading in the same broad direction. The long-range promise, they say, is technology that becomes a layer of data-driven artificial intelligence that resides on top of both the physical and digital worlds, helping people to make faster and smarter decisions as a kind of clever software assistant.
Mr. Etzioni, other scientists say, makes a good point, but the current enthusiasm for big data methods is understandable. "The dramatic successes of big data have caused everyone to rush over to that side of the boat," said Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington, who is on the board of the Allen Institute.
And the correlation and prediction of data science has certainly been good to Mr. Etzioni, whose talents include being a successful entrepreneur. He was a founder of Farecast, whose software predicted the best time to buy airline tickets. Microsoft bought Farecast in 2008. He was also a founder of Decide, a web site that sifted through historical price data and user recommendations to help consumers make buying decisions. Ebay purchased Decide in 2013.
The keynote speaker on Tuesday morning, Eric Horvitz, a computer scientist at Microsoft Research, emphasized all that can be done with big data tools. His talk was titled, "Data, Predictions, and Decisions in Support of People and Society." In his presentation, Mr. Horvitz described several projects he and his team were working on. One involves using patient, treatment and historical data to predict which hospital patients are most at risk of being readmitted within 30 days, and suggest follow-up monitoring. Studies show that 20 percent of Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days at an estimated cost of $17.5 billion a year, in addition to the toll in human suffering.
Later, in a hallway conversation, a university computer scientist asked Mr. Horvitz about whether the software draws conclusions about the causes of hospital re-admissions. You can construct plausible explanations from the data, Mr. Horvitz replied. "But we don't care," he added. "Of course, we care in general. But it doesn't matter to the effectiveness of the technology."
In an interview, Mr. Horvitz, who is an academic adviser to the Allen Institute, agreed with Mr. Etzioni that the long-range goal is computer systems that can reason rather than merely recognize patterns and correlations and make predictions. But Mr. Horvitz chose a different emphasis. "I think we can have a huge impact in so many fields, in the shorter term, along the way to reasoning systems," Mr. Horvitz said.

'This is bigger than just Timnit': How Google tried to silence a critic and ignited a movement

Timnit Gebru-a giant in the world of AI and then co-lead of Google's AI ethics team-was pushed out of her job in December.
Gebru had been fighting with the company over a research paper that she'd coauthored, which explored the risks of the AI models that the search giant uses to power its core products-the models are involved in almost every English query on Google, for instance. The paper called out the potential biases (racial, gender, Western, and more) of these language models, as well as the outsize carbon emissions required to compute them. Google wanted the paper retracted, or any Google-affiliated authors' names taken off; Gebru said she would do so if Google would engage in a conversation about the decision. Instead, her team was told that she had resigned. After the company abruptly announced Gebru's departure, Google AI chief Jeff Dean insinuated that her work was not up to snuff-despite Gebru's credentials and history of groundbreaking research.
The backlash was immediate. Thousands of Googlers and outside researchers leaped to her defense and charged Google with attempting to marginalize its critics, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. A champion of diversity and equity in the AI field, Gebru is a Black woman and was one of the few in Google's research organization.
"It wasn't enough that they created a hostile work environment for people like me [and are building] products that are explicitly harmful to people in our community. It's not enough that they don't listen when you say something," Gebru says. "Then they try to silence your scientific voice."
In the aftermath, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai pledged an investigation; the results were not publicly released, but a leaked email recently revealed that the company plans to change its research publishing process, tie executive compensation to diversity numbers, and institute a more stringent process for "sensitive employee exits."
In addition, the company appointed engineering VP Marian Croak to oversee the AI ethics team and report to Dean. A Black woman with little experience in responsible AI, Croak called for "more diplomatic" conversations within the field in her first statement in her new role.
But on the same day that the company wrapped up its investigation, it fired Margaret Mitchell, Gebru's co-lead and the founder of Google's ethical AI team. Mitchell had been using an algorithm to comb through her work communications, looking for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. In a statement to Fast Company, Google said that Mitchell had committed multiple violations of its code of conduct and security policies. (The company declined to comment further on this story.)
To many who work in AI ethics, Gebru's sudden ouster and its continuing fallout have been a shock but not a surprise. It is a stark reminder of the extent to which Big Tech dominates their field. A handful of giant companies are able to use their money to direct the conversation around AI, determine which ideas get financial support, and decide who gets to be in the room to create and critique the technology.
At stake is the equitable development of a technology that already underpins many of our most important automated systems. From credit scoring and criminal sentencing to healthcare access and even whether you get a job interview or not, AI algorithms are making life-altering decisions with no oversight or transparency. The harms these models cause when deployed in the world are increasingly apparent: discriminatory hiring systems; racial profiling platforms targeting minority ethnic groups; racist predictive-policing dashboards. At least three Black men have been falsely convicted of a crime based on biased facial recognition technology.
For AI to work in the best interest of all members of society, the power dynamics across the industry must change. The people most likely to be harmed by algorithms-those in marginalized communities-need a say in AI's development. "If the right people are not at the table, it's not going to work," Gebru says. "And in order for the right people to be at the table, they have to have power."
A dominant force
Big Tech's influence over AI ethics is near total. It begins with companies' ability to lure top minds to industry research labs with prestige, computational resources and in-house data, and cold hard cash.
Many leading ethical-AI researchers are ensconced within Big Tech, at labs such as the one Gebru used to lead. Gebru herself came from Microsoft Research before landing at Google. And though Google has gutted the leadership of its AI ethics team, other tech giants continue building up their own versions. Microsoft, for one, now has a Chief Responsible AI officer and claims it is operationalizing its AI principles.
But as Gebru's own experience demonstrates, it's not clear that in-house AI ethics researchers have much say in what their employers are developing. Indeed, Reuters reported in December that Google has, in several instances, told researchers to "strike a positive tone" in their papers' references to Google products. Large tech companies tend to be more focused on shipping products quickly and developing new algorithms to maintain their supremacy than on understanding the potential impacts of their AI. That's why many experts believe that Big Tech's investments in AI ethics are little more than PR. "This is bigger than just Timnit," says Safiya Noble, professor at UCLA and the cofounder and codirector of the Center for Critical Internet Inquiry. "This is about an industry broadly that is predicated upon extraction and exploitation and that does everything it can to obfuscate that."
The industry's power isn't just potent within its own walls; that dominance extends throughout academia and the nonprofit world, to a chilling degree. A 2020 study found that at four top universities, a more than half of AI ethics researchers whose funding sources are known have accepted money from a tech giant. One of the largest pools of money dedicated to AI ethics is a joint grant funded by the National Science Foundation and Amazon, presenting a classic conflict of interest. "Amazon has a lot to lose from some of the suggestions that are coming out of the ethics-in-AI community," points out Rediet Abebe, an incoming computer science professor at UC Berkeley who cofounded the organization Black in AI with Gebru to provide support for Black researchers in an overwhelmingly white field. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 9 out of the 10 principal investigators in the first group to be awardedNSF-Amazon grant money are male, and all are white or Asian. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.)
"When [Big Tech's] money is handed off to these other institutions, whether it's large research-based universities or small and large nonprofits, it's those in power dictating how that money gets spent, whose work and ideas get resources," says Rashida Richardson, the former director of policy at AI ethics think thank AI Now and an incoming professor of law and political science at Northeastern Law School.

It doesn't help that people in academia and industry are "playing in the same sandbox," says Meredith Broussard, a data journalism professor at NYU. Researchers move freely between Big Tech and academia; after all, the best-paying jobs for anyone interested in the problems of ethical technology are at the companies developing AI.
That sandbox often takes the form of conferences-one of the primary ways that researchers in this space come together to share their work and collaborate. Big Tech companies are a pervasive presence at these events, including the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT), which Mitchell cochairs (Gebru was previously on the executive committee and remains involved with the conference). This year's FAccT, which begins in March, is sponsored by Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft, among others. And although the event forbids sponsors to influence content, most conferences don't have such clear policies.
The most prestigious machine learning conference, NeurIPS, has had at least two Big Tech companies as primary sponsors since 2015, according to the same 2020 study that analyzed the influence of Big Tech money in universities. "When considering workshops [at NeurIPS] relating to ethics or fairness, all but one have at least one organizer who is affiliated or was recently affiliated with Big Tech," write the paper's authors, Mohamed Abdalla of the University of Toronto and Moustafa Abdalla of Harvard Medical School. "By controlling the agenda of such workshops, Big Tech controls the discussions, and can shift the types of questions being asked."
One clear way that Big Tech steers the conversation: by supporting research that's focused on engineered fixes to the problems of AI bias and fairness, rather than work that critically examines how AI models could exacerbate inequalities. Tech companies "throw their weight behind engineered solutions to what are social problems," says Ali Alkhatib, a research fellow at the Center for Applied Data Ethics at the University of San Francisco.
Google's main critique of Gebru's peer-reviewed paper-and the company's purported reason for asking her to retract it-was that she didn't reference enough of the technical solutions to the challenges of AI bias and outsized carbon emissions that she and her coauthors explored. The paper, called "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?," will be published at this year's FAccT conference with the names of several coauthors who still work at Google removed.
Who's in the room
When Deborah Raji was an engineering student at the University of Toronto in 2017, she attended her first machine learning research conference. One thing stood out to her: Of the roughly 8,000 attendees, less than 100 were Black. Fortunately, one of them was Gebru.
"I can say definitively I would not be in the field today if it wasn't for [her organization] Black in AI," Raji says. Since then, she has worked closely with Gebru and researcher-activist Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, on groundbreaking reports that found gender and racial bias in commercially available facial recognition technology. Today, Raji is a fellow at Mozilla focusing on AI accountability.
The field of AI ethics, like much of the rest of AI, has a serious diversity problem. While tech companies don't release granular diversity numbers for their different units, Black employees are underrepresented across tech, and even more so in technical positions. Gebru has said she was the first Black woman to be hired as a research scientist at Google, and she and Mitchell had a reputation for building the most diverse team at Google Research. It's not clear that the inclusion they fostered extends beyond the ethical AI team. This workplace homogeneity doesn't just impact careers; it creates an environment where it becomes impossible to build technology that works for everyone.
Root causes: From how AI research is funded to who gets hired, the industry's problems run deep
[Sources: "The Grey Hoodie Project: Big Tobacco, Big Tech, and the Threat on Academic Integrity," Mohamed Abdalla and Moustafa Abdalla; The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2018; Element AI, Global AI Talent Report 2019; Artificial Intelligence Index 2018]

Academic institutions and nonprofits that focus on AI and ethics suffer from similar problems with inclusion. When Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI) was announced in 2019, the academics affiliated with it were overwhelmingly white and male, and not a single one was Black. (The institute, which receives funding from Google, has since added more diverse faculty to its staff). HAI's codirector is AI luminary Fei-Fei Li, who was Gebru's adviser for her doctoral research at Stanford. Li has not spoken publicly about Gebru's ouster and declined to comment for this story.
Meanwhile, a new analysis of 30 top organizations that work on responsible AI-including Stanford HAI, AI Now, Data & Society, and Partnership on AI-reveals that of the 94 people leading these institutions, only three are Black and 24 are women. "A lot of the discussions within the space are dominated by the big [nonprofit] institutions, the elites of the world," says Mia Shah-Dand, a former Google community group manager turned entrepreneur and activist who did the analysis through her nonprofit, Women in AI Ethics. "A handful of white men wield significant influence over millions and potentially billions in AI Ethics funding in this non-profit ecosystem, which is eerily like the overall AI tech for-profit ecosystem," Shah-Dand writes in her report.

This widespread lack of diversity-and the siloing of AI ethics within elite institutions-has resulted in a disconnect between research and the communities that are actually impacted by technology. AI ethics researchers are often focused on finding technical ways of "de-biasing" algorithms or mathematical notions of fairness. "It became a computer-science-y problem area instead of something that's connected and rooted in the world," says Emily Bender, a professor of linguistics at University of Washington and Gebru's coauthor for "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots."
Bender, Gebru, and others say it's important to empower researchers who are focused on AI's impacts on people, particularly marginalized groups. Even better, institutions should be funding researchers who are from these marginalized groups. It's the only way to ensure that the technology is inclusive and safe for all members of society.

"There are people in the world who have been suffering from discrimination and marginalization for generations, and [technology is] adding layers on top of that," Bender says. "This isn't just some long-term abstract problem we're trying to solve. It's people being harmed now."
A growing movement
"If you've never had to be on public assistance, you don't understand surveillance," says Yeshimabeit Milner, the cofounder and executive director of the nonprofit Data 4 Black Lives, which examines how the data that undergirds AI systems is disproportionately wielded against marginalized communities. Facial recognition surveillance, for example, has been used in policing, public housing, and even certain schools.

Milner is part of a growing group of activists and researchers intent on documenting how AI and data affect real people's lives and using that research to push for change. Efforts such as the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), the Detroit Community Technology Project, and the Our Data Bodies Project use community organizing and education to help people harmed by algorithms, compel companies to amend their technology, and push for AI regulation.
Our Data Bodies, for example, has embedded community researchers in cities such as Charlotte, Detroit, and Los Angeles. "Across all three cities, [community members] felt like their data was being extracted from them, not for their benefit, but a lot of times for their detriment-that these systems were integrating with one another and targeting and tracking people," says Tawana Petty, a Detroit-based activist who worked with the Our Data Bodies Project. She is now the national organizing director of Data 4 Black Lives. 
These organizations have made some progress. Thanks to the work of the AJL and others, several prominent companies including IBM and Amazon either changed their facial recognition algorithms or issued moratoria on selling them to police in 2020, and bans on police use of facial recognition technology have been spreading across the country. The Stop LAPD Spying Coalition sued the LAPD for not releasing information about its predictive policing tactics and won a victory in 2019, when the department was forced to expose which individuals and neighborhoods had been targeted with the technology.

In Detroit, Petty has been tracking the rise of the city's Project Green Light, which began in 2016 when local law enforcement installed a handful of facial recognition-powered cameras; the program has now expanded to more than 2,000 cameras. She's focused now on creating a bill of rights for Detroit residents that would change the city's charter. "We're hoping to get a ban on face recognition," she says. "If we succeed, we'll be the first predominantly Black city to do so."
"This activist work is exactly what we need to do," says Cathy O'Neil, data scientist and founder of the algorithmic auditing consultancy ORCAA. She credits activists with changing the conversation so that AI bias is "a human problem, rather than some kind of a technical glitch."
It's no coincidence that Black women are leading many of the most effective efforts. "I find that Black women as people have dealt with these stereotypes their entire lives and experienced products not working for them," says Raji. "You're so close to the danger that you feel incredibly motivated and eager to address the issue."

A chorus of activists and researchers argues that people who have been targeted by technological systems should be part of their design and deployment. That's why Data 4 Black Lives is putting the tools of data science in the hands of Black people to use for their own benefit. When Milner realized that states weren't tracking coronavirus cases by race-creating a dearth of evidence for how the virus has disproportionately impacted Black Americans-her organization recruited volunteers to build a codebase that tracks state-level data on COVID-19 deaths and cases by race.
Data 4 Black Lives is also bringing together activists and researchers to collaborate on addressing data-related problems; in Atlanta, that means teaching data science skills. "It doesn't have to be complicated. It can be as simple as a 300-person survey," Milner says. "It's about using that information to paint a picture of what's happening."
Training more people on the basics of using data is part of Milner's mission to ensure tech is built equitably-and to bring into the conversation more people who've experienced algorithmic harms. "If we're going to build a new risk assessment algorithm, we should definitely have somebody [in the room] who actually knows what it's like to move through the criminal legal system," she says. "The people who are really the experts-in addition to amazing folks like Dr. Gebru-are people who don't have PhDs and who will never step foot in MIT or Harvard."
Rebalancing tech's power
For many researchers and advocates, the ultimate goal isn't to raise the alarm when AI goes wrong, but to prevent biased and discriminatory systems from being built and released into the world in the first place. Given Big Tech's overwhelming power, some believe that regulation may be the only truly effective bulwark to halt the implementation of destructive AI systems. "Right now there's really nothing that prevents any type of technology from being deployed in any scenario," Gebru says.
The tide may be turning. The Democrat-controlled Congress will likely reconsider a new version of the Algorithmic Accountability Act, first introduced in 2019, which would force companies to analyze the impact of automated decision-making systems. The sponsors of that bill, including Senators Cory Booker and Ron Wyden and Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai after Gebru was forced out, raising concerns about Google's treatment of Gebru, highlighting the company's influence in the research community, and questioning Google's commitment to mitigating the harms of its AI.
Clarke says that regulation can prevent inequalities from getting "hardened and baked into" AI decision-making tools, such as whether or not someone can rent an apartment. One critique of the original Algorithmic Accountability Act was that it didn't have the teeth to truly prevent AI bias from harming people. Clarke says her goal is to beef up the enforcement powers of the FTC "so another generation doesn't come into [using technology] with the bias already baked in."
Antitrust lawsuits could help change the balance of power for small businesses as well. Last year, the House Judiciary Committee called out how Big Tech uses its monopolistic control of the data required to train sophisticated AI to suppress small companies. "We [shouldn't] take the power of these companies as a given," Milner says. "It's about questioning that power and trying to find these creative policy solutions."
Other proposals for regulation include starting an FDA-like entity to create standards for algorithms and address data privacy, and raising taxes on companies to fund more independent research. UCLA's Noble believes that by not paying their fair share in taxes, tech companies have starved the government in California, so that public research universities such as her own simply do not have enough resources. "This is part of the [reason] why they've had a monopoly on the discourse about what their tech is doing," she says. There's some precedent for this: Our Data Bodies originally received funding as part of the 2009 settlement of a lawsuit against Facebook for its Beacon program, which shared people's purchases and internet history on the platform.
"Regulation doesn't come out of nowhere, though," says Meredith Whittaker, a prominent voice for tech-worker organizing. Whittaker helped put together the 2018 Google Walkout and is the cofounder and director of AI Now. "I think we do need strong, organized social movements to push for the kind of regulation that would actually remediate these harms."
Indeed, worker activism has been one of the few mechanisms to force change at tech companies, from Google walking away from its drone image analysis project Maven to ending the practice of forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Individuals within Big Tech firms can not only protest when their products are going to be used for ill, they can push to ensure diverse teams are building these products and auditing them for bias in the first place-and band together when ethicists such as Gebru and Mitchell face retaliation.
Seeta Gangadharan, the cofounder of Our Data Bodies and a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, goes one step further, proposing that tech workers need to be taught how to be whistleblowers. She envisions summer schools for computer science graduates that would arm them with the resources for going public. That way, workers are already trained to reveal inside knowledge of harmful technologies that their future employers may develop.
A month after Gebru was pushed out of Google, hundreds of workers at its parent company, Alphabet, announced that they were unionizing. For Alex Hanna, a senior researcher on Gebru's former team at Google, the Alphabet Workers Union is a crucial step. "The union is a strong counterweight, especially for AI workers who want to speak up against some of the abuses companies are perpetuating through AI products," she says. For Gebru, the union is one of the few hopes for change that she has. "There has to be a lot of pressure," she says.
Hanna cautions that building up this countervailing force to combat Big Tech's influence will take time. Others are less patient. "These companies have so much power," says Shah-Dand. "Someone has to dismantle them, whether it's inside or outside."

San Francisco startup makes data science a sport

Strange secrets hide in numbers. For instance, an orange used car is least likely to be a lemon.
This particular unexpected finding came to light courtesy of a data jockey who goes by the Internet alias SirGuessalot, who in fact wasn't guessing at all. Instead, he and his partner, PlanetThanet, relied on the hard math skills that make them top contenders in a sport tailor-made for the 21st century: competitive number-crunching.
The used car defect prediction contest is one of dozens hosted by San Francisco online startup Kaggle, whose creators believe they can tap the global geek population's instinct for one-upmanship to mine better answers faster from the world's ever-rising mountain of data.
"Competitions bring together a wide variety of people into a wide variety of problems," said Jeremy Howard, who became Kaggle's president and chief scientist after winning multiple competitions himself. "You get people looking at stuff they'd never look at otherwise."
While the used car contest was fun, Kaggle has its eye on weightier scientific problems. In one contest, an English major who trained himself in data science built a model for predicting the progress of HIV infections in individual patients. In another, a scientist who studies glaciers for a living won a NASA-backed Kaggle competition to measure the shapes of galaxies by mapping the universe's dark matter.
The data problems that need solving are so important that those who find the solutions should be paid like professional athletes, said Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom. By turning data-mining into a crowdsourced contest, he hopes he's created a way to make that happen. Already one of Kaggle's contests offers a multimillion dollar prize.
"We want to see the best data scientists earning more than Tiger Woods," said Goldbloom, who started the company in his native Australia and recently came to San Francisco's South of Market startup haven.
The job market for mathematicians and statisticians has become hot as the sheer volume of data generated by ever faster, cheaper computing resources explodes.
Data storage has become so inexpensive that a 2011 McKinsey and Co. report estimated that a disk drive capable of storing all the world's music would cost about $600. Walmart stores 10 times more data on customer transactions and other parts of its operation than is contained in the entire Library of Congress, according to the same report.
Analyzing the so-called "big data" deluge has become a key task for businesses in an effort to divine everything from which ads online customers will click to how much inventory they need to maintain. Political candidates analyze data to predict voting patterns. Dating websites try to predict ideal mates.
Kaggle competitions focus on creating and testing formulas that can be used to make predictions based on the contents of giant datasets.
The more accurate the formula, the better the chances it will accurately provide answers to complex questions, such as the orange used car being the least likely to break down.
Goldbloom argues that no matter how many data scientists companies hire, relying on in-house data talent means companies can't know if they're getting the best solution.
In a Kaggle contest, competitors find out as soon as they submit their solutions how they stack up against fellow contestants. They can keep trying for the duration of the typically three-month contests, which are highlighted on the company web site.
As the first entries come in, the accuracy of competing models improves by leaps, Goldbloom said. As the contests progress, the improvement curve flattens out. Goldbloom and Howard believe that shows the competitive approach pushes data scientists toward the best solutions within human reach.
"Crowdsourcing allows you to squeeze data dry," Goldbloom said.
Not all competitions are open to all comers, however. About 33,000 contestants have taken part in Kaggle's public competitions, where prize money tends to top out at around $10,000. Winners can get invited to participate in elite private contests, which may include access to sensitive private data sets.
Kaggle's business model depends on deep-pocketed contest sponsors like banks seeking to outdo each other with more lucrative prize purses to attract the best competitors, who themselves in theory could then make their livings off Kaggle competitions alone.
The biggest prize by far open to the public is $3 million offered by the California-based Heritage Provider Network medical group to the data scientist best able to use hospital admission records to predict the profiles of people most likely to end up in the hospital. The next-biggest purse is $100,000 in prizes put up by the Hewlett Foundation for algorithms that can automatically grade student essays.
In its grandest vision of itself, the 11-person company backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin will have tens of thousands of competitions running simultaneously. Guilds of data gurus will band together to unleash software that enters competitions automatically. Kaggle becomes not just a way to push humans to perform at their best but to make machines themselves smarter as code-based contestants battle and "learn" from their mistakes.
In this way, Howard said, data competitions become steps along the development of artificial intelligence systems such as self-driving cars.
As for why orange used cars are most likely to be in good shape, the numbers did not hold the answer. One notion was that such a flashy color would only attract car fanatics who would be more likely to take care of their vehicles. That didn't pan out, however, since the least well-kept used cars turned out to be purple.

Organ transplants in the United States have been increasing over the last several years. In 2019, transplants from deceased donors rose by 10% while living donors increased by 7%. The growing system combines education, technological advances, various research, and public policy work to save lives off the 100,000-person waitlist. While kidneys are the top organ in transplant numbers, other key organs transplanted in America include the liver, heart, and lungs. The transplant community has been working together for years to increase organ donations for those in need.
Experts say that deceased donors alone will not resolve the waitlist. Organizations like the American Kidney Fund (AKF), among other things, work to get rid of kidney disease in the first place. They provide education and access to resources to help make it easier, and encourage living donors to save a life.
As a kidney donor myself, I can confirm that multiple organizations work hard to make organ donation a safe and rewarding experience. Despite the progress in recent years, more living donors are necessary. Especially now.
Beginning in late March of last year as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the U.S., the country's transplant system came to a screeching halt. Deceased donor donations dropped by 50% and living donor donations dropped by 90%.
"The pandemic caught everybody off guard," says Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer at United Networks for Organ Sharing (UNOS). "Nobody really saw it coming. Transplant is really a collaborative process by nature."
In order for a surgery to be successful it requires both the transplant center and the donor hospital to be fully operational and functional, along with the organ procurement team for deceased donor organs; potential recipients and donors also have to have access to healthcare. Not only did COVID-19 affect all these groups individually, but it only takes one of them with a problem to disrupt the entire system.
Waves of impact
Once the pandemic hit, healthcare resources had to pivot. In many regions, beds, operating rooms, and healthcare workers were used mainly for treating COVID-19 patients. Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles was just one transplant center that had to reallocate resources.
"Demand for resources and staffing and patient care had to be focused on the COVID-19 patients," says Dr. Irene Kim, co-director of Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Transplant Center. "Some of the transplant staff had to be redeployed and help care for COVID-19 . . . needs: testing for COVID-19, for example. Now, some of our nursing and MD staff are still administering vaccines."
On top of resource reallocation, hospitals pulled back inpatient services because of safety questions. "We didn't know about the virus, and we were just figuring out how to test donors," says Kim. "We were learning so much as a medical community about the virus, not only in transplant but medicine in general. It wasn't a safe environment to transplant. In L.A., 60% of deceased donors were testing positive for COVID-19. We can't take those organs."
Questions arose about the spread of the virus, how donors and recipients would be affected by the virus, and even how to safely allow different transplant and organ collection teams into hospitals. "Donor hospitals were reluctant to admit outside transplant teams and procurement teams, because of issues around potential safety for their own staff and patients. On top of this, potential recipients had difficulty accessing hospitals," says Klassen.
The transplant system and healthcare facilities were immediately and profoundly impacted by the pandemic. Individually, recipients and donors were hit just as hard, in different ways. The economic downturn rippled through people's access to healthcare. Jobs were lost, which impacted insurance and access to treatment. Dialysis patients found themselves in the scary predicament of not only being unable to put food on the table or pay their rent, but also unable to afford their co-pays and premiums for life-saving treatment.
"The biggest impact we saw was financial," says Mike Spigler, VP of patient services and kidney disease education at the American Kidney Fund. "In March we launched a coronavirus emergency fund, a financial assistance program offered to dialysis and recently transplanted patients. It was a small $250 grant and we seeded it with $300,000. Normally that amount would last a few months but we ran out of that money by 3 p.m. on day one. We were getting requests every 26 seconds. Our patients needed help paying bills, getting food on the table, and paying rent." The AKF has provided financial assistance for more than 13,000 patients with $3.15 million.
"I have one patient who rents a couch out of an apartment for $200 a month," Spigler adds. "He is undocumented, he is on dialysis, and he got laid off his job as a dishwasher. When he got a new job, he got sick and was diagnosed with COVID-19 the day before his first shift. He had no choice, he told his social worker he planned to go into work because he has to pay that rent or else he will be out on the street." The AKF was able to provide that patient with a grant for that month so he could stay home and keep others from being exposed.
Pivoting to save lives
Changes in practice were required if the system was to continue transplantation after the pandemic's initial disruption. Teams worked to get all donors tested for coronavirus so that those organs could be utilized and deceased donor transplants could continue. By late April, 100% of donors were being tested. UNOS instituted policies to unburden transplant centers from unnecessary administrative tasks associated with patient follow up. Telehealth took a very large role in post-operative patient care.
"The actual transplant is the easy part," says Kim. "The hard part is all the post-operative recovery. Our typical model is to bring a kidney transplant patient back twice a week for physical exams and monitoring. Our typical liver recipient comes back every week after transplant and twice a week for labs. Are we really going to bring this immunosuppressed patient back to possible exposure multiple times a week?"
Video visits and telehealth systems were put into place in March and April, alongside the general rethinking of post-operative care. Kim notes that nothing replaces a physical exam, lab draws, and human contact, so it didn't erase all visits but it did lower the number of in-person visits while still allowing for the patient to be monitored.
Another shift in practice included changes to donor procurements. The teams that usually came to retrieve organs for transplant found that they weren't always allowed in hospitals. There was more use of local staff to procure in order to keep with safety procedures and allow transplants to continue.
"When New York hospitals were filled with COVID-19, the transplant community collaborated to honor the gift of life and make sure people in other areas were able to use available organs," says Anne Paschke, communications specialist at UNOS. "It was amazing how the transplant community came together and shared everything that they were learning so that other areas could learn."
UNOS hosted webinars that connected experts around the world to share their experiences and research so that doctors and transplant centers could learn quicker than by their own experience alone. On March 23, during the first webinar, a heart transplant doctor in Italy spoke about treating COVID-19-infected transplant recipients; on December 3, a Duke University Medical Center doctor shared findings on administering the vaccine to transplant recipients.
"The level of collaboration was impressive," says Klassen. "The pandemic obviously was a world-wide event and within the transplant world there's been clearly successful international collaboration and a lot of the early clinical knowledge came from outside the U.S. It allowed us to recuperate faster and keep the system moving ahead."
A very different transplant experience
Theresa Caldron, a registered nurse in Oklahoma and AKF Ambassador, was able to receive a life-saving transplant once the system was able to resume some surgeries. She received an organ others had declined because of COVID-19. "I was diagnosed with kidney failure, autoimmune disorder, and renal failure," she says. "Back in 2009, we knew I needed a kidney transplant but I wasn't put on the transplant list until 2017. They let us know for the time being they were doing it on a case-by-case situation, they were not doing live donor surgeries in Oklahoma because they outlawed elective surgeries. The person who was before me on the list turned it down . . . I may not have gotten this kidney if it wasn't for the pandemic."
Caldron and her family had a very different transplant experience than most. "My husband had to drop me off at the front doors of the hospital and pick me up there when I was discharged," she says. "We weren't allowed in-person visits." After the surgery Caldron didn't see her doctor for six months, as all clinical visits were pivoted to be virtual. Both she and her husband are nurses, so their medical background allowed them the ability to feel comfortable without in-person visits, although she says that staff encouraged her to call for any reason at any time.
The care that Caldron received while in the hospital was different as well: "I was on a floor that they use specifically for transplant and cancer patients. Oklahoma lagged in COVID-19 numbers, hitting at a different time than other areas, and the hospital was pretty empty. I was only one of around five patients on this floor, so I received amazing care."
Hospitals fully prepped for large waves of COVID-19 infections that came at different times in different regions. Elective surgeries were postponed immediately; some came back in the following months. Many hospitals did not ultimately see an overflow of COVID-19 patients, although they put preventative safety procedures into place. "You had these hospitals that fully prepared for COVID-19 care, but the increase in COVID-19 inpatients did not make up for the decrease in elective surgeries and patients that deferred their care," says Jennifer Ittner, senior director of data science at Strata Decision Technology.

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, transplants were ultimately able to resume to levels similar to the year before. There was not the level of growth that was originally expected, but deceased donor transplants increased 6% from 2019, while living donor transplants decreased by 22% from 2019. Some transplant centers were impacted more harshly than others: Cedars-Sinai ended both living and donor transplants at 529 in 2020, the same number as in 2019, and an increase from 471 in 2018.

Currently, organs from COVID-19-infected patients are not being used for transplants, but there are serious discussions currently taking place around the world in regards to their future use.
"I think that the next three to five years are going to be hugely instrumental in how we understand how the coronavirus impacts transplant across the board: vaccination, donors, recipients," says Cedars-Sinai's Kim. "At this point in time we are still on that learning curve with transplants and coronavirus. From a month ago to a month from now, it's constantly changing."

Highlight: Columbia University held a symposium that mainly focused on the promise of Big Data technology, but concerns were raised that the technology was racing ahead of society&#8217;s understanding of it. 


Body


 Columbia University held a daylong symposium on Friday as a kind of brainy coming-out party for its new Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering. The institute is a collection of interdisciplinary centersincluding ones for cybersecurity, financial analytics, health analytics, new media and smart cities. It points to the direction universities will have to take if the bundle of technologies called Big Data - new data and artificial intelligence tools - really are to transform industries, as its champions predict.
The symposium, "From Big Data To Big Ideas," was mainly a celebration of the promise of the technology in fields from health care to transportation, with presentations from Columbia professors and computer scientists from companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Bloomberg.
The privacy and surveillance perils of Big Data came up only in passing. But during a question-and-answer portion of one panel, Ben Fried, Google's chief information officer, expressed a misgiving. "My concern is that the technology is way ahead of society," Mr. Fried said. There is danger, he suggested, if only a technical elite understand Big Data and its implications, with the risk of a runaway technology or a public rejection.
I spoke with Mr. Fried briefly afterward. "I think it is a mistake if conversations about this technology leave out the humanities," he said. Broader social concerns, he explained, should be a guide and will affect the spread and use of Big Data technology.
Mr. Fried works for a company that has at times tested the limits of Big Data technology, notably the privacy threat posed by overaggressive data collection. But he makes a good point, and he's not the only one making it.
Alex Pentland, a computational social scientist at the MIT Media Lab, is leading a group at MIT and elsewhere in exploring the implications of what he calls "a data-driven society."
At Columbia, Mark Hansen, a professor of journalism and director of the institute's New Media Center, has his own plan for bringing the humanities into Big Data. He teaches students from Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism how to do some data programming. The goal, Mr. Hansen explains, is not to make them professional programmers, but mainly to give journalists - whom he calls "society's explainers of last resort" - a firmer understanding of computer technology. Software algorithms, he said, are not impartial. They are written by people, and can embody human values and biases.
Mr. Hansen's small-scale educational program recalls the major initiative at Dartmouth College in the 1960s, when mainframe computers, the transforming technology of the day, came into widespread use in business, government and science. It was there that two professors, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, developed Basic, a simplified programming language, initially for Dartmouth students. They were influenced by the concerns raised by C.P. Snow, the English scientist and novelist, in his 1959 lecture, "The Two Cultures," which analyzed the difference between scientific and literary intellectuals, and pointed to the danger of the schism.
The Columbia data sciences institute is just getting under way. New centers could be added. One of the panelists on Friday suggested Columbia might want to add something like the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, which focuses on the impact of technology on society.
The Columbia institute is a science-led undertaking, and its director is a computer scientist, Kathleen R. McKeown. Incidentally, Ms. McKeown, who was the first female professor to receive tenure in the engineering school, holds a bachelor's degree in comparative literature.

Falstaff is a provider of temporary nurses for hospitals while U.S. Nursing provides strike preparedness and job action staffing services for hospitals with unionized workforces. At the closing of the deal, Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. the current owner of both Fastaff and U.S. Nursing, will remain an investor.

PRESS RELEASE

NEW YORK, Feb. 24, 2021 – Cornell Capital LLC ("Cornell Capital") and Trilantic North America, two leading private investment firms, today announced that they have agreed to acquire Fastaff Travel Nursing® (“Fastaff”) and U.S. Nursing Corporation® (“U.S. Nursing”).

This acquisition is part of a broader effort by Cornell Capital and Trilantic North America to build a leading tech-enabled platform for healthcare staffing, following three other recently announced acquisitions in the space: trustaff Management, Inc. (“trustaff”), a leading provider of traditional travel nurse and allied healthcare staffing services; CardioSolution, a managed services offering providing cardiologists and support personnel to hospitals; and Stella.ai, Inc. (“Stella”), an AI-driven online marketplace for employers and job seekers that brings cutting-edge technology expertise to the staffing sector. With the addition of Fastaff and U.S. Nursing, the combined company will create an industry-first platform, leveraging data science and automation to meet client needs across traditional nurse staffing, rapid response, strike preparedness and job action services to accelerate growth.

Founded in 1989, Fastaff and U.S. Nursing have provided hospitals with staffing solutions for more than three decades. Fastaff pioneered the practice of Rapid Response? travel nurse staffing and has since grown to become the leading provider of temporary nurses to help hospitals provide continuous, high-quality patient care in urgent and crucial situations nationwide. U.S. Nursing is the largest provider of strike preparedness and job action staffing services for hospitals with unionized workforces. Together, Fastaff and U.S. Nursing partner with many of the nation’s largest and most prestigious healthcare facilities, as well as small community hospitals, using a scalable, centralized infrastructure and shared technology.

“We are excited to add Fastaff and U.S. Nursing to further diversify our innovative healthcare staffing platform, whose enhanced technology and AI will help drive future growth,” said Stephen Trevor, Partner of Cornell Capital, and Jeremy Lynch, Partner of Trilantic North America. “We have been impressed by the performance of Fastaff and U.S. Nursing for their health system customers both prior to and during the global pandemic. With each company’s track record of execution and deep hospital relationships, we look forward to partnering together as we continue to build an industry-leading organization and grow this platform organically, geographically and through additional acquisitions.”

Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL”), current owners of Fastaff and U.S. Nursing, will remain investors in the combined company.

“We invested in Fastaff and U.S. Nursing in 2015 with a thesis behind the increasingly mission-critical nature of their urgent and crucial staffing services to their hospital partners,” said Megan Preiner, Managing Director at THL. “During the global pandemic, the importance of these services has only been amplified, and these two brands have been able to consistently deliver nurses to their customers during these times of unprecedented demand. We are excited to remain partnered with the Fastaff and U.S. Nursing teams in this next evolution as the combined new entity will allow for continued efficiency and automation of the nurse staffing experience for their customers.”

“For more than three decades, Fastaff has been a premier provider of Rapid Response? travel nurse staffing, and U.S. Nursing has been the industry leader in comprehensive job action consulting and staffing solutions,” said Bart Valdez, Fastaff and U.S. Nursing CEO. “Our team has the utmost confidence that partnering with Cornell Capital and Trilantic North America will help us build on our unique market position delivering experienced nurses for urgent hospital needs. Bringing the capabilities of our two brands to this larger platform will accelerate organic growth, allow for greater product and service innovation, and position the combined company to help meet the nation’s expanding healthcare staffing needs.”

“Combining Fastaff and U.S. Nursing to our recent acquisitions of trustaff and CardioSolution on one platform will increase the scale and diversity of staffing opportunities we can deliver to both clients and healthcare professionals,” said Adam Zoia, who has been named CEO of the combined company. “I look forward to applying superior technology to these best-in-class businesses and teams to strengthen their brands and accelerate growth at this critical moment for the industry across our country.”

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close in March 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Stitch Fix's former data chief wants to personalize your food at Daily Harvest

Brad Klingenberg, who oversaw Stitch Fix's formidable personalization and curation efforts as the company's Chief Algorithms Officer, is taking on a new challenge: tailoring salads, flatbreads, smoothies, and desserts exactly to your taste at Daily Harvest.
The six-year-old company makes easy-to-blend smoothies, veggie-filled harvest bowls, soups, lattes, oat bowls, and healthy desserts that can be made by simply warming them up or popping them in a blender. Customers order Daily Harvest's offerings by signing up for a weekly or monthly plan and receiving deliveries already portioned and ready to eat. As the company's first Chief Data Officer, Klingenberg hopes to use the data collected by the company to make its meals even more delicious.
At San-Francisco-based Stitch Fix, which Klingenberg joined more than seven years ago as the third person on the now 100+ data team, algorithms learn people's preferences over time by getting feedback on the clothes customers receive in a monthly box and through data on the website. Eventually, the algorithms learn to generate tailored recommendations and even advise vendors on possible clothing alterations. If many customers think a sweater is too short, for example, they might relay that information back to the manufacturer to change the design.
"There's almost no corner of the business that's not touched by data science in some way," Klingenberg says. That includes recommending clothes for users' curated clothing boxes, as well as optimizing buying and inventory, and even developing new clothes.
Now, he hopes to bring some of his methods to help create, distribute, and personalize food at Daily Harvest. The subscription service works similarly to Stitch Fix: The company gathers data on customer preferences, looking at what they order and surveying them to see if their plant-based recipes need altering-like an ingredient change, or different ingredient proportions.
"Daily Harvest is a brand and platform that allows better nutrition, which in our definition is having people eat more fruits and vegetables, because those are objectively good for us," says CEO Rachel Drori.
Unlike at Stitch Fix, which doesn't make all the clothes it sells, Daily Harvest oversees its entire supply chain. "Because we have that direct connection, because we have all the data associated with that, what we're able to do is we're able to basically figure out preferences," Klingenberg says.
Because of Daily Harvest's agile supply chain-and the fact that it is easier to change a recipe than a sweater-new products or recipes can hit the market within eight weeks with prices starting at $5.99 per item.
Klingenberg, who says he never saw himself working in fashion, also worked on the recommendations algorithm at Netflix.
But there's one key difference between creating recommendation algorithms for TV and creating them for food. "My husband and I live in the same house, swipe the same credit card, we have the same level of education," points out Drori. "But all of the data that might be involved in traditional product development goes completely out the door when it comes to dinner time. I want to eat a salad and my husband wants to eat meat and potatoes."
While most food companies are forced to rely on demographic data to figure out what customers might like, Daily Harvest can use data gathered from its surveys, questionnaires, and past orders to whip up food tailor-made to your taste buds.

Reeling from the death of her father in January, Ms. Hill, a 29-year-old freelance photographer, had barely adjusted to her new normal when the pandemic hit and further upended her life. 
  After the death of a friend in June, when her hair appeared to thin even more, she created a folder on her phone titled Hairgate, featuring every selfie she'd taken in the last four years.
  ''I was trying to figure out where it all went wrong,'' said Ms. Hill, who lives in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
  It's a quandary many people, particularly women, have agonized over in recent months, as their brushes and shower drains filled with tangles of hair. Google searches for hair loss increased by 8 percent in the last 12 months, according to the data science firm Spate, with the topic being searched an average of more than 829,000 times a month in the United States.
  The phenomenon is not all in our heads, according to experts, but is another frustrating byproduct of both immense stress and post-viral inflammation from Covid-19. Known as telogen effluvium in the medical world, temporary hair loss results from fever, illness and severe stress, pushing more hairs than normal into the shedding phase of the hair growth life cycle.
  Although hair loss tends to be associated with men because of the prevalence of male-pattern baldness, telogen effluvium is more common among women, who often experience it after childbirth.
  ''Any type of severe stress can trigger it, whether it's stress on your body from illness or emotional stress such as the death of a loved one,'' said Dr. Abigail Cline, a dermatologist at New York Medical College who has conducted research on pandemic-related hair loss. ''Even though not everyone has been infected with Covid-19, we're all living with it.''
  Tackling Hair Loss Holistically
  For those who have had the virus, hair loss has become a common symptom of the recovery process, usually occurring three to four months after getting sick but sometimes experienced sooner. Dr. Jerry Shapiro, a dermatologist at NYU Langone Health who specializes in hair loss, said that while a healthy head of hair usually includes 90 percent anagen, or growing, hairs and 10 percent telogen, or resting, hairs, that ratio can shift up to 50-50 after experiencing a high fever or flulike illness.
  For Misty Gant, a 35-year-old wellness coach living on the Lower East Side, the change happened fast. After being infected in March, Ms. Gant started losing handfuls of her long red hair in the shower and began to notice balding at her temples a few weeks after recovering.
  ''It was really hard because my hair is important to me -- it's part of my identity,'' she said, noting that before it thinned, it was her most complimented feature.
  Ms. Gant, who regularly dives into health and wellness research for clients, soon landed in forums full of people who had gone through similar post-Covid-19 hair loss. After doctors confirmed her suspicion that she was suffering from a post-viral inflammatory response, she readied an arsenal of holistic remedies to try to fix it.
  Her first point of attack was an anti-inflammatory diet that cut out sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol and incorporated colorful fruits and vegetables, oily fish and healthy fats like avocados and nuts. She kick-started a new supplement routine of Omega 3-6-9, turmeric with fenugreek, evening primrose oil and two tablespoons of aloe juice a day, a combination she believes to be anti-inflammatory and lubricating for the skin and hair.
  She began giving herself daily scalp massages using Bumble and Bumble Tonic Primer, which includes rosemary oil, an ingredient that some studies have found to encourage hair growth. Two days a week she doused her hair in a mixture of coconut oil and pure rosemary oil and left it in for 24 hours. Though not a quick fix, it seemed to pay off: She now has tufts of baby hair growing in at her temples.
  ''I try to do everything the natural way, and as a wellness practitioner, I know that things take time,'' Ms. Gant said.
  A Less Intensive Approach
  Although it can still take months to see a significant difference, many people have had similar results from a combination of supplements, thickening shampoos and illusion-creating haircuts.
  After her husband noticed a few bald spots on the back of her head early in the pandemic, Martyna Szabadi, a 34-year-old business consultant who hasn't had Covid-19, experimented with products said to promote hair growth, including various scalp scrubs, a hair serum from the Ordinary and a daily drink of flax seed water. Nothing helped until she began using RevitaLash Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and taking four capsules of Nutrafol core supplement for women.
  ''After half a year of this combination, I finally have the hair issue under control,'' Ms. Szabadi said.
  Nutrafol supplements also seemed to help Ms. Hill get her hair back on track after she began taking them in July, leaving her with a slimmer part and new hair growth around the crown. It was a boom year for the company, with revenue increasing 60 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Giorgos Tsetis, the chief executive and a founder of the company.
  Mr. Tsetis said that 80 percent of the company's sales increase can be attributed to its two core formulas for women: Nutrafol Women and Women's Balance. They include ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc and biotin, the last of which has become widely known as a hair growth supplement despite the fact that dermatologists disagree over its efficacy.
  ''No one's really been able to prove it helps hair in a randomized controlled study, and they've had a long time to prove it,'' Dr. Shapiro said.
  But with wellness ruling the day, Nutrafol's chemical-free, made-from-the-earth virtue has made it a popular option. Nutrafol bills itself as a ''natural, holistic'' alternative to old-school remedies like Rogaine, or minoxidil, which is a topical solution used to improve blood flow and stimulate hair growth.
  Another treatment option is platelet rich plasma therapy, known as P.R.P., which involves the injection of a patient's own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Priced between $500 and $1,800, P.R.P. doesn't work for everyone and is best done alongside other treatments, according to Dr. Shapiro, who believes it's a better fit for people experiencing female or male-pattern baldness, which has a genetic cause.
  The Quicker Fix
  If waiting three months for a shampoo or supplement to kick in doesn't thrill you, consider a haircut that will make your hair look healthier than it is. Justine Marjan, a hairstylist whose clients include Kardashians and the model Ashley Graham, recommends a shorter, blunt cut to create an illusion of thickness.
  ''It's best to avoid longer looks, as the hair can end up looking weak and frail at the ends,'' Ms. Marjan said. If your hair loss is most noticeable at your hairline or part, she suggests using an eye shadow or root touch-up spray that matches your hair color to create depth and the appearance of fullness. Using headband-style extensions that you can easily pop on and off without damaging the hair is another favorite trick.
  Most important, be gentle and strategic with your hair. Ms. Marjan recommends drying fragile hair with a soft microfiber towel and using a tool like the Tangle Teezer to prevent breakage. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is also believed to minimize breakage. And, while many people resort to ponytails when their hair is limp, it's best to avoid tight styling that could pull out more hair.
  What's definitely not great for hair growth? Constant panic.
  ''Stressing about it will only cause more hair loss,'' Dr. Cline said, noting that a deep, six-month-long breath is a better prescription. ''I reassure patients with telogen effluvium that their hair will grow back, but it's going to take time.''

The questions lawmakers should ask at a hearing today.
Senator Mitt Romney has joined the lineup for the DealBook DC Policy Project on Feb. 22-23. Speakers include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev, the New York attorney general Letitia James and others discussing what’s next for business and policy. Register here to attend, from anywhere in the world, free of charge.
We have questions
At noon Eastern today, the House Financial Services Committee will dive into the meme-stock frenzy, interrogating some of the key players in the mania surrounding GameStop and other stocks favored by internet forums. The hearing — in which most of the committee’s 53 members are set to participate — threatens to be full of noise and bluster, as these events often are.
Here is who’s on deck to testify today, and questions that might elicit the most illuminating responses.
Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. His online brokerage was the preferred venue for the frenzy, but its decision to halt some trading in GameStop and other stocks because of capital constraints prompted outrage across the political spectrum.
• You’ve been lobbying for real-time settlement of stock trades, saying the current two-day delay led to Robinhood’s trading curbs. If there had been real-time settlement, would your brokerage have had enough capital to avoid restrictions at the height of the frenzy?
• Robinhood says it offers retail investors free trading, but that’s because your company sells customer trades to market makers like Citadel Securities. Can you explain the benefit to firms that pay you to execute trades?
• Brokerages lend their clients’ shares to short sellers. Would you consider asking Robinhood users to opt in to allow the lending of their holdings?
Ken Griffin of Citadel Securities. The billionaire’s business empire includes both a huge hedge fund that had bet against GameStop and a giant market maker that executes trades for Robinhood and others.
• How is letting firms like Citadel Securities pay to execute retail customers’ orders good for mainstream investors?
Gabe Plotkin of Melvin Capital. His hedge fund, and its big bet against GameStop, was a primary target of scorn by Reddit traders who sought to squeeze him out.
• How does allowing stocks like GameStop’s to have short interest of more than 100 percent — that is, more of a company’s shares being sold short than are available to trade — make financial markets more efficient, as short sellers claim?
Jennifer Schulp of the Cato Institute. The director of financial regulation studies at the think tank plans to testify that the meme-stock phenomenon didn’t pose a systemic risk.
• You say that the “unintended consequences” of regulatory changes in response to the meme-stock mania should not be underestimated. What are the consequences of not acting? Should investors expect episodes like the GameStop frenzy to become a regular feature of markets?
Steve Huffman of Reddit. His online platform is the home of WallStreetBets, the forum that helped egg on the meme-stock frenzy.
• You’ve said there wasn’t much your company could do to guard against market manipulation, but why shouldn’t your company be held liable if there is fraud on its platform?
Keith Gill. The registered broker who, in his personal time, touted GameStop on YouTube and Reddit, plans to tell Congress his social media messages were purely for educational purposes.
• Away from your persona as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube, you were the director of financial wellness education at MassMutual. With your “financial wellness” hat on, what would have been the message you gave clients about investing in GameStop?
• You say you are “as bullish as I’ve ever been” about GameStop. What’s your price target?
The Times will run a live briefing with video and analysis of the hearing, starting at noon Eastern.
HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING 
Facebook and Google come to opposite conclusions on paying for news in Australia. A proposed law in the country would require platforms to pay media publishers for content that appears on their sites. In response, Google announced a deal with News Corp (one of many this week), while Facebook blocked all links to news articles on its platform in Australia.
The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the South African strain. The shot generated a slightly lesser immune response to the variant than to earlier versions of the virus, but remained capable of neutralizing it, new research showed. 
The Texas freeze shakes up global oil markets. The cut in Texas shale production because of winter storms — some four million barrels a day of output — is keeping petroleum prices up worldwide. Saudi Arabia plans to take advantage by raising its output.
Rush Limbaugh dies at 70. The right-wing provocateur made talk radio a potent force in business and politics. Allies praised him as a trailblazer for political pundits; critics said he presaged the Trumpian politics of conspiracy mongering.
Is Robinhood a cryptocurrency whale? The online brokerage appears to be the single biggest holder of Dogecoin, the digital token whose value has soared nearly 1,000 percent in recent weeks, according to reports. Robinhood itself won’t confirm the speculation.
Everyone’s an influencer now
We are all conduits in the “hype machine,” according to the M.I.T. professor Sinan Aral, acting as data conveyors in online systems designed for “hypersocializing.” The stunning rise (and fall) of GameStop’s stock, driven in part by individual investors coalescing on social media, shows the new power of connected crowds, Mr. Aral said in an interview with DealBook.
“Crowds can scale, collaborate and coordinate in ways we have never seen before,” Mr. Aral said, and that power can be harnessed for good or ill. He analyzed 10 years of Twitter activity, and found that novelty travels far and fast, and that false news, which tends to be more novel than the truth, is shared more freely than facts.
• This leads to the postmodern problem of “hyperreality,” in which simulations and symbols that feel real lead to disagreements over what is true.
All investors speculate on as-yet-unrealized values, traditionally tied to financial fundamentals. For example, the trader Keith Gill (see above) will testify today that he believed the retailer GameStop could reinvent itself, justifying a higher share price. This was shared online and it convinced others. But as the crowd felt its power, the thesis became “let’s stick it to the hedge funds,” Mr. Aral said. This didn’t alter GameStop’s prospects, but fortunes were gained and lost based on the power of a crowd to create a new reality.
To harness the promise and minimize the perils of a “new social age,” insights from data science about the power of the “hype machine” should be applied to design better policies, Mr. Aral said. “We need a national commission on technology now.” 
• The professor also recommended that we all hone our reflective powers to become more discerning influencers. Here’s a puzzle to test your reflection: A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? (Here’s the not-so-obvious answer.)
“It’s something that is certainly here to stay. Whether it is here to stay at these levels in the mid- to long term, we’ll have to see.”
— Thomas Gottstein, the C.E.O. of Credit Suisse, on SPACs. His firm’s advisory work for blank-check companies bolstered its investment bank in its latest quarter.
Exclusive: Russell Westbrook’s bank shot
The N.B.A. star Russell Westbrook is leading a $63 million investment in Varo Bank, a digital chartered bank, in a deal that DealBook hears values the company at about $1.3 billion. The funds will help Varo grow — including in brand awareness — and develop programs to promote financial literacy for people of color.
An assist in expanding access. When Mr. Westbrook, the point guard for the Washington Wizards, and his investment partners approached Varo with the idea, the bank, having recently raised more than $240 million ahead of getting its bank charter, was not actively looking for more funds. But Varo’s C.E.O., Colin Walsh, said he and Mr. Westbrook, who will serve as an adviser to the bank, were “aligned from a mission perspective.” Mr. Westbrook said his work with Varo will be “part of an economic revitalization for those who never had the access they deserved.”
Shooting for an I.P.O. Varo was founded in 2015 and is backed by the likes of Warburg Pincus and TPG. The bank expects to go public “in the next couple of years” and forecasts that it will be cash-flow positive this year, said Mr. Walsh. The prospects for fintech regulation under President Biden are up in the air, but Mr. Walsh said the company has “built really great relationships” with regulators, who appreciate the “authenticity” of its mission.
On that $500 million mistake
Yesterday, we recounted the saga of Citigroup’s mistaken transfer of $900 million to creditors of Revlon, and why a judge ruled that a group refusing to return $500 million to the bank is allowed to keep it (pending appeal). Based on the deluge of opinions we received from readers, the ethics of this issue are fraught.
Speaking of ethics, Randy Cohen, the original Ethicist columnist for The Times Magazine, weighed in. He is now the host of Person Place Thing, an interview show on public radio.
“When the creditors received a much bigger payment than expected, they knew or could easily have found out if it was sent in error: pick up the phone and ask. Since it was sent by mistake, the money must be returned. I know of no school of ethics that encourages exploiting an honest error. Similarly, if Citigroup strolls past Allstate, one of the creditors in the dispute, and Allstate sees it drop its wallet, then Allstate must return the wallet, not pocket the cash.”
And here are some of your responses:
• “If this was a small company I would be more sympathetic. The fact that this is a large institution that should have better systems in place sways me to rule: tough luck and get it together Citigroup!” — Audrey in Exeter, N.H.
• “Hats off to the lenders who rightfully returned the money. To those who kept it and gloated over Citi’s error, karma will take care of you.” — Lisa in Arlington, Tex.
• “If I accidentally sent Citi an extra mortgage payment (or three), I guarantee you they would not give it back.” — Patrick in Boston
• “You can be honest, ethical, commercially reasonable businesspeople, or you can keep the money.” — Jeffrey in Newton, Mass.

Many doctors report an uptick in patients suffering from stress-related hair loss. Here’s what to do about it.
With every month that passed in 2020, Samantha Hill’s part seemed to widen, the increasingly bald stripe of skin a representation of what she calls “a four-part terrible play” in her life. Reeling from the death of her father in January, Ms. Hill, a 29-year-old freelance photographer, had barely adjusted to her new normal when the pandemic hit and further upended her life.

ROBOTS SPEEDING UP THE OFFICE ROUTINE; Local startups are leading the $2 billion industry creating software to automate repetitive workplace tasks
Crain's New York Business

Ernst & Young's robots don't scurry around the office, delivering mail and performing other ordinary tasks. But the accounting firm saved 2 million work hours last year, thanks to robotic software that performed mostly paperwork-heavy jobs, such as data processing and customer billing, that clerical staff would normally handle.
"You have automation doing the manual tasks that, frankly, humans don't want to do and shouldn't be doing, which then allows them to focus on higher-value activities," said Jeff Aldridge, who leads EY's Intelligent Automation practice for the Americas.
Called robotic process automation, the software speeds up repetitive tasks in data entry and document processing. It is growing so quickly that research firm Gartner expects that 70% of the routine tasks for corporate managers will be automated within three years. New York's historic strength in document-heavy industries ripe for automation-financeinsurance and health care-has helped launch a new generation of startups focused on this technology. At the same time, the technology's growing popularity raises difficult questions about whether it will soon replace jobs, rather than making them easier.
Automation is typically depicted in media as physical robots-the Jetsons' maid Rosie or the humanlike machines of I, Robot. While physical robots are increasingly used in warehouses and hospitality settings, some of the fastest-growing automation is happening through corporate software.
Software automation is not new, as some programs date back more than a decade. But the challenges of the pandemic-working remotely and processing documents solely in digital formats-has accelerated its trajectory. Research firm Bain & Co. estimated last May that based on a survey of 800 corporate executives, the number of companies scaling up software automation will double in the next two years. Spending on such software will reach $2 billion this year, up 20% from last year, according to Gartner's research.
New York startups that make software for businesses raised a record $5.5 billion last year, up from $3.3 billion in 2019, according to a report from Flatiron District venture capital firm Work-Bench, with automation technologies capturing 20% of that capital.
Exploding market
EY is both a client and a partner of UIPath, a Midtown startup that is a leader in robotic process automation. UIPath, which moved its headquarters from Romania to Park Avenue in 2017, is valued by private investors at $35 billion. It filed confidentially for an initial public offering at the end of last year.
"This is a market that is really exploding right now," said Matt Turck, a partner at venture capital firm FirstMark. "The whole hoopla around the term 'digital transformation,' that's really what this is: deployment of software and data, and AI, to accelerate the agility of companies."
"The problem is that the back offices of the largest enterprises in the world have not kept up with the technologies in the marketplace at all," said Charlie Newark-French, chief operating officer of Hyperscience, an automation startup with an office at 1 World Trade Center.
That's an opportunity for Hyperscience. Founded in 2014, the firm uses artificial intelligence to automate data extraction. The software sits in the background as employees tackle regular daily tasks, such as transferring data from a mortgage application to a central server. It then assesses how humans do their jobs and eventually offers digital shortcuts through bots and other automation.
TD Ameritrade used Hyperscience to process the sea of customer documents it received after its $4 billion acquisition of Scottrade in 2017, which the company said in a case study cut the process from an estimated 12 months to four.
Hyperscience raised $60 million from investors in June, followed by an additional $80 million in October. The firm employs 250, about 90 of whom have been hired in the past 12 months.
Hypersicence, UIPath and two other New York-based firms, Workfusion and Kryon, were included on a list of the fastest-rising automation firms last summer by CB Insights.
When Work-Bench began investing in New York startups seven years ago, the city's biggest success stories came from advertising and consumer products, not business software, noted Jonathan Lehr, the Flatiron District firm's co-founder.
As tech giants like Facebook and Google opened offices and built workforces in the city, "people got experience solving the hardest data and cloud challenges and then spun out and built these enterprise startups," Lehr said.
Harald Collet left an executive role at Bloomberg LP in 2016 to launch Alkymi, a startup that automates data entry from emails to company servers. He said too often clients of his were losing time copying-and-pasting data from financial documents sent by email into formats they could easily use.
The firm raised $5 million in seed funding last February and has since expanded its staff from five to 30. Demand has increased as more companies are operating remotely.
"The mailroom is closed, and everyone is doubling down on digital," Collet said.
Friend or foe?
A challenge for the emerging industry is proving it can bring value and win over employees to break their work habits. A Boston Consulting Group survey of 825 corporate executives in October found that just 30% of automation projects fulfilled their goals, such as cutting costs or boosting productivity.
During his 2020 presidential bid, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned automation could cause economic upheaval and proposed a "robot tax" to penalize companies that automate jobs.
Andrew Yang focused his presidential campaign around the threat of automation, proposing universal basic income as a solution. He has brought a modified version of that policy to his platform for the 2021 mayoral race.
The World Economic Forum projects that automation could displace 85 million workers by 2025 in roles that include bookkeeping, data entry and auditing. But the October report noted that 97 million new jobs could come from automation in that same period, including in data science and software development.
"Automation often comes with the sense of doom, that the robots are taking over," said Iris Chung, director of learning experience design at General Assembly, a technology training company in the Flatiron District.
She said companies investing in training can fight that perception. General Assembly has partnered with Midtown-based Guardian Life Insurance, for instance, to train actuaries on using data science skills.
The Center for an Urban Future has spent several years advocating for the city and the state to offer or incentivize workplace training. The Manhattan-based group estimates at least 450,000 jobs in New York could be at risk
"A lot of job training focuses on getting people into the market," said Jonathan Bowles, the organization's executive director. "But this will have to be about bolstering the skills of workers already in the labor force."
To companies like Hyperscience, software automation isn't displacing any jobs, just eliminating monotonous tasks so companies can move faster.
"If you can make taking out an insurance policy quicker and easier, more customers will enter that market," said Newark-French. "Companies that embrace automation would then become larger and employ more people."

Everberg Capital has provided funding that is backing Two Sigma Impact and BayPine's investment in Penn Foster, an online workforce education platform. No financial terms were disclosed. BC partners and FS Investments also participated in Everberg's investment.

PRESS RELEASE

NEW YORK, 02 FEBRUARY 2021 – Everberg Capital (“Everberg”), a structured capital fund focused on investing primarily in the U.S. middle market, announced the closing of a significant preferred equity investment supporting Two Sigma Impact and BayPine’s investment in Penn Foster, a leading workforce education platform for middle-skilled workers. BC partners and FS Investments among other institutional investors joined Everberg in the preferred equity investment. The transaction marks a watershed moment in Everberg’s growth and evolution and was its largest to date.

Founded in 1890 as a correspondence school, Penn Foster has evolved into a digital learning platform focused on closing the skills gap by preparing workforce-ready employees for middle-skilled careers. Penn Foster serves more than 300,000 adult learners seeking to move beyond entry-level employment, graduating more than 40,000 students each year. In “Unstuck in the Middle,” a white paper released by Penn Foster last year, the company made the case that recognizing skill attainment along a spectrum could unlock economic mobility for workers employed in jobs that require more than a high school diploma but not a four year degree. According to the National Skills Coalition, while middle-skill jobs make up the largest portion of the US labor market, just 44% of workers are currently trained to the middle-skill level. A recent study published by the nonprofit, Opportunity@Work, suggests that the estimated 71 million Americans who lack four-year degrees, but are

“Skilled Through Alternative Routes” (STARs), represent an untapped pool of talent for US employers.

Scott Siegel, Managing Partner, at Everberg Capital said: “COVID-19 is further driving the demand for self-paced remote education programs and accelerating the trend towards digital learning. We are proud to support Penn Foster as it continues to up-skill and re-skill workers, which is paramount in securing a job in this challenging labor market. Our investment in Penn Foster highlights our commitment to investing in socially responsible companies with community-focused partners. We firmly believe a healthy corporate ecosystem is built upon alignment of interests and principles of transparency, integrity, and understanding.”

Ian Blasco, Partner, at Two Sigma Impact said: “Everberg was the ideal partner for us. They created a customized financing solution tailored to the needs of the company and then worked quickly to execute it. We look forward to partnering with them again in the near future.”

Tom O’Rourke, Managing Director, at BayPine said: “We are pleased to partner with Scott, the Everberg team, and Two Sigma Impact to invest in Penn Foster and develop a modern, agile education platform that leverages the power of data to drive better outcomes for working learners.”

About Penn Foster

Don't Be Embarrassed: Embrace the Blush

Blush has become the unlikely makeup hero of the masked generation. Here's the new way to wear it.
It may be a surprise to learn that blush, a makeup item long associated with 1980s-style glamour, is poised to make a major comeback. While lipstick or contour can't be seen under our masks, and wearing lots of eye makeup feels like too much of a dedicated effort, blush is becoming the hero bit of makeup that can add an instant pop of color to the face. 
  Blush sales and searches appear to be increasing at a time when other makeup categories are not. According to new research from the data provider Semrush, blush is the third-most searched beauty product in the United States, and the data science team at Pattern, an e-commerce partner, has reported a rise in demand for blush.
  Adding face color is fun, after all. ''Too much time inside, without the inspiration of others and the opportunity to decorate our faces, makes it all the more fun when we can,'' said Caroline Barnes, a makeup artist. She recently did a high-impact blush look around the eyes of the actress Nicola Coughlan, who stars in the Shondaland period romp ''Bridgerton.''
  Here, then, are some new ways to wear blush -- how to choose the right color, how to apply it, and more -- in the age of wearing a mask.
  Brighten Your Complexion
  When used strategically, blush can infuse warmth into any complexion, a much-needed boost when you've been indoors for months. ''You can add instant brightness by adding touches of corals and pinks,'' Ms. Barnes said.
  To warm up a complexion, she suggests applying it in a soft circular shape over the apples of your cheeks.
  ''If a complexion doesn't have enough life, there are so many ways to wear it,'' said Katie Jane Hughes, a makeup artist who works with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. One of Ms. Hughes's favorite techniques is to go for a ''super-blushy look,'' making it the focus of your entire makeup look.
  Go Retro
  With mask wearing, blush has moved up, above the mask line, closer to the eyes and on the tops of cheekbones. ''The old way that I used to do it has become new again,'' said the makeup artist Sandy Linter, who wrote the book ''Disco Beauty'' and did makeup for Diana Ross, Jerry Hall and Jackie O. ''It's high up on the cheekbone, and then it swings into like a C shape into the temples. Make sure you blend it, so it doesn't look that obvious.''
  Ms. Barnes has also been using maximum blush and taking inspiration from the '70s and '80s, extending color over the eye socket and sweeping it up toward the temples. ''You can use the same shade over your entire lid or wash the blush over your usual eye shadow, either way works,'' she said.
  Ms. Hughes has been taking an equally retro approach, sweeping blush over the eyes and brow instead of doing a complicated eye makeup look. ''I think of it like a soft little accent in an '80s kind of way, all the way up into the eye and the brow,'' she said.
  Opt for Monochromatic Themes
  Another modern touch for those who aren't blush averse: Choose your blush and coordinate the rest of your makeup look to it. ''Pick whatever your color is, and make the blush and everything else match,'' said Ms. Hughes, who recently experimented with a bright pink style. ''Then just do loads of lashes. It's so chic and simple but impactful because it's harmonious.''
  Mix and Match Your Colors
  The great thing about blush is that choosing the right color isn't hard, and the new style of blush favors the bold. Chiao Li Hsu, another makeup artist, said that there are no rules when it comes to color, and she works with neon yellows or vivid reds when applying blush over the apples of the cheeks and up into the eye sockets.
  ''You can use any color,'' Ms. Hsu said. She is also a fan of using draping techniques, taking deeper pinks and reds under the eyes and over the cheeks.
  ''It's fun to play with several shades and textures of pink to make a monochromatic look more exciting and to add a bit of depth,'' she said.
  Other makeup artists like to mix multiple colors to get a custom look. ''Enhance your bone structure by using a tone a couple of shades darker than your skin tone, mixed with a nude hue,'' Ms. Barnes said.
  Choose a Texture, and a Tool
  Today's blushes come in many textures -- cream, powder, liquid. When wearing a mask, a liquid tint that dries down is the most transfer-proof option. But you can also use blush to change the texture of your complexion overall.
  ''Cream is great for dry skin,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''And powder for oily skin as a rule, but it's personal preference. Natural makeup works well with creams, but with powder you can be more direct on where you place it, and it tends to last longer.''
  Ms. Linter prefers to play with multiple textures. ''You can wear both textures at once and layer,'' she said. But the tool is just as important as the texture you choose. Opt for a sponge when using creams; fingers work fine with liquids; and use a brush for powders.
  ''Brushes are very, very important,'' she said. ''Some big, soft brushes are very ineffective. They don't do anything. For blush, you need to have a pretty full-sized brush, but it needs to be a little on the firm side so that when you hit your skin, it controls the powder and keeps it so you can spread it correctly in the right place.''
  Blend, but Not Too Much
  Blending is the key to making blush modern, but not so much that you overdo it and lose the color.
  ''If I'm watching people put makeup on and they're not fans of blush, I can always tell because they'll apply it and then ferociously rub it in,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''What ends up happening is they rub it off as they're blending it in. Just pick up a tiny bit, apply it slowly. You shouldn't see the payoff immediately. You should see it gradually.''
  At the end of the day, however, Ms. Hughes cautions that there are really no strict rules with blush. ''If you like an actual cheek moment, do it,'' she said. ''If you like a high-up-into-the-temples moment, you should do that. Experiment to see what you like.''

How unhealthy is the air in the world’s major cities?
Note: We will not be hosting a live-moderated “What’s Going On in This Picture?” discussion on Feb. 17. 
These graphs show the air quality for twelve major world cities from November 2018 to November 2019. The key for the amount of air pollution uses both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index and the PM2.5 concentration (airborne particulate matter suspended in air that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers — more than 100 times thinner than a human hair). Much of this pollution is from burning things: coal in power plants, gasoline in vehicles, chemicals in industry, and wildfires.
After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:
• What do you notice? 
• What do you wonder? 
• What impact does this have on you and your community?
• What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.
The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. 
2. Next, join the conversation online by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box. (Teachers of students younger than 13 are welcome to post their students’ responses.)
3. Below the response box, there is an option for students to click on “Email me when my comment is published.” This sends the link to their response which they can share with their teacher.
4. After you have posted, read what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting a comment. Use the “Reply” button to address that student directly.
On Wednesday, Feb. 24, teachers from our collaborator, the American Statistical Association, will facilitate this discussion from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time.
5. By Friday morning, Feb. 26, we will reveal more information about the graph, including a free link to the article that included this graph, at the bottom of this post. We encourage you to post additional comments based on the article, possibly using statistical terms defined in the Stat Nuggets.
The Reveal 
These graphs appeared in the December 16, 2019 New York Times article “What It Means to Breath the World’s Most Polluted Air: ‘You Can’t Function, You Can’t Thrive.’” The number of deaths from outdoor particulate pollution is staggering: in 2015, 4,200,000 deaths worldwide with 88,000 deaths in the United States. Weakened regulations and a reduction in enforcement have led to an increase in air pollution since 2016, reversing years of decline.
Anything that is burned causes air pollution: coal in power plants, gas in vehicles, chemicals in industry and wildfires. Evidence of wildfires in San Francisco, caused in part by climate change, can be seen in the spike in air pollution in its graph.
Air pollution is linked to asthma and other lung diseases, heart attacks and stroke, as well as developmental problems in children and cognitive impairment in older people. As we saw in the February 10 “What’s Going On In This Graph?” graph on U.S. air pollution, pollution knows no borders. It travels from polluters to the surroundings. It affects young and old, rich and poor. But, pollution does not affect all groups equally. A 2019 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that in the United States, people of color tend to breathe dirtier air than white Americans, despite contributing far less to overall pollution. Why do you think this is the case?
Here are some of the student headlines that capture the stories of these graphs: “Is Your Air Just Air?” by Conner of Iowa, “Air Pollution Poisoning Many Cities From Around the World.” By Ashley of Massachusetts, “Global Air Pollution Trends: Some Cities Breath Easy, While Others Long for a Breath of Fresh Air” by Jacki of Switzerland, “Death in the Air. O, So Much Despair!” by Mia of Washington, “Air Pollution, the Silent Killer” by Tegan of Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire and “What Kind of Air Are You Breathing?” by Genesis of Pennsylvania.
You may want to think critically about these questions:
• The New York Times Learning Network produced a Lesson of the Day based on a New York Times article “Who Gets to Breathe Clean Air in New Delhi?” From the article and included videos of two children Monu and Aamya who live in New Delhi, you will learn about how air pollution threatens each differently based on their families’ income. You can compare their different levels of air pollution to your level by using the interactive feature of our article “What It Means to Breath the World’s Most Polluted Air: ‘You Can’t Function, You Can’t Thrive.’” What is your reaction to the article and to this comparison?
• Alexandra Karambelas, a scientist who is affiliated with Columbia University, believes “having access to clean air is kind of a basic human right.” Do you agree? If clean air is a right, how could clean air be provided to all?
• Go to the article that included these graphs where you can see a video of the movement of worldwide air pollution for the same time period as the graphs. Note the major pollution events, including seasonal events. Which regions are the biggest air polluters? Where does their pollution spread?
• Berkeley Earth, an independent U.S. non-profit organization focused on environmental data science, provided the data for these graphs. Here you can see the real-time air pollution around the world for all dates in the past two years. Take a tour of the maps and share what you notice and wonder about air pollution worldwide.
The next graph on the relationship smoking and household income will be released by Friday, Feb. 26 with live-moderation on Wednesday, March 3. You can receive the 2020-2021 “What’s Going On In This Graph?” schedule by subscribing here to the Learning Network Friday newsletter. In the meantime, keep noticing and wondering.

TIME SERIES GRAPH
A time series graph shows how a numerical (quantitative) variable changes over time.
In the World Cities Air Pollution graphs, the length of the bars represent the numerical variable of daily air pollution for November 2018 through October 2019. Air pollution is measured by the amount of airborne particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers per cubic meter. The graphs’ scale shows the correspondence between the amount of particulate matter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality index, with a color range from green for good air to red for hazardous and extreme pollution.
INTERVALS for GRAPH SCALES
The space between each marked value on the scale of a bar graph is called an interval. The length of intervals are chosen based on the range of the values in the data set. Interval lengths on linear scales are equal. Some graphs are constructed using logarithmic scales, which have unequal length intervals.
In the World Cities Air Pollution graphs, the interval length is equal to 25 micrograms per cubic meter). The intervals are marked by parallel horizontal dotted lines.

BayPine and Two Sigma Impact have made a "significant" investment in digital learning platform Penn Foster. No financial terms were disclosed. Macquarie Capital served as financial advisor to Penn Foster while William Blair & Company was co-advisor. Everberg Capital also participated in the transaction. Penn Foster was backed by Bain Capital Double Impact, the impact investing unit of Bain Capital.

PRESS RELEASE

Boston, MA – January 21, 2021– Workforce development pioneer Penn Foster today announced a significant new investment from BayPine and Two Sigma Impact to accelerate the build-out of its digital learning platform focused on preparing frontline workers to thrive within high-growth, high-skill jobs. The two investment businesses will partner with Penn Foster to bring new capabilities in data science and advanced technology to help the company continue to offer practical, affordable solutions to its students.
“Skill gaps and economic mobility are, in many ways, two sides of the same coin,” said Frank Britt, Chief Executive Officer of Penn Foster. “This investment reflects our belief that the combination of advanced labor market analytics with low-cost digital training can help individuals make better-informed decisions about their educational investments. It's about enabling employers to close skill gaps by identifying and creating career paths for historically untapped talent.”

A digital learning platform that works in partnership with employers, public workforce agencies, and community-based organizations, Penn Foster delivers skill-based training for more than 300,000 working learners each year. In addition to offering accredited programs and certificates in fields ranging from healthcare to skilled trades, Penn Foster partners with major employers, including Lowe’s and Walmart, to provide high school diploma and career training courses that are often on-ramps to higher wage roles.

“Two Sigma Impact believes that by focusing on creating a better workforce, we can create long term value and better business outcomes,” said Ian Blasco, Partner at Two Sigma Impact. “We are excited to work with Penn Foster to apply advanced data science techniques to the development of dynamic, skills-based training that is tightly coupled with the demands of the labor market.”

“For decades, Penn Foster has been at the forefront of delivering flexible, affordable, and job-relevant development programs that have redefined the intersection of education and work,” said Anjan Mukherjee, Managing Partner at BayPine. “The implementation of digital transformation initiatives to unlock human potential is core to our thesis, and we look forward to working closely with management to develop a modern, agile platform at Penn Foster that leverages the power of data to drive better outcomes for working learners.”

In “Unstuck in the Middle,” a white paper released by Penn Foster last year, the company made the case that recognizing skill attainment along a spectrum could unlock economic mobility for workers employed in jobs that require more than a high school diploma but not a four year degree. According to the National Skills Coalition, while middle-skill jobs make up the largest portion of the US labor market, just 44% of workers are currently trained to the middle-skill level. A recent study published by the nonprofit, Opportunity@Work, suggests that the estimated 71 million Americans who lack four-year degrees, but are “Skilled Through Alternative Routes” (STARs), represent an untapped pool of talent for US employers.

“The critical need for different ways to approach training and education for workers has become more prominent in the past few years, and the pressure on our economy created by the pandemic has only emphasized that the time has come for a workforce transformation,” said Ann Ruble, Operating Partner at Two Sigma Impact. “New data-driven approaches to learning will help expand access to training in high-demand fields for both workers and employers at a time when it is needed most.”

This investment represents the next phase of Penn Foster’s growth following a successful partnership with Bain Capital Double Impact, the impact investing unit of Bain Capital. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Macquarie Capital served as financial advisor and William Blair & Company as co-advisor to Penn Foster. Everberg Capital also participated in the transaction. Jamieson provided transaction management advice.

Blush has become the unlikely makeup hero of the masked generation. Here’s the new way to wear it.
It may be a surprise to learn that blush, a makeup item long associated with 1980s-style glamour, is poised to make a major comeback. While lipstick or contour can’t be seen under our masks, and wearing lots of eye makeup feels like too much of a dedicated effort, blush is becoming the hero bit of makeup that can add an instant pop of color to the face.
Blush sales and searches appear to be increasing at a time when other makeup categories are not. According to new research from the data provider Semrush, blush is the third-most searched beauty product in the United States, and the data science team at Pattern, an e-commerce partner, has reported a rise in demand for blush.
Adding face color is fun, after all. “Too much time inside, without the inspiration of others and the opportunity to decorate our faces, makes it all the more fun when we can,” said Caroline Barnes, a makeup artist. She recently did a high-impact blush lookaround the eyes of the actress Nicola Coughlan, who stars in the Shondaland period romp “Bridgerton.”
Here, then, are some new ways to wear blush — how to choose the right color, how to apply it, and more — in the age of wearing a mask.
Brighten Your Complexion
When used strategically, blush can infuse warmth into any complexion, a much-needed boost when you’ve been indoors for months. “You can add instant brightness by adding touches of corals and pinks,” Ms. Barnes said.
To warm up a complexion, she suggests applying it in a soft circular shape over the apples of your cheeks.
“If a complexion doesn’t have enough life, there are so many ways to wear it,” said Katie Jane Hughes, a makeup artist who works with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. One of Ms. Hughes’s favorite techniques is to go for a “super-blushy look,” making it the focus of your entire makeup look.
Go Retro
With mask wearing, blush has moved up, above the mask line, closer to the eyes and on the tops of cheekbones. “The old way that I used to do it has become new again,” said the makeup artist Sandy Linter, who wrote the book “Disco Beauty” and did makeup for Diana Ross, Jerry Hall and Jackie O. “It’s high up on the cheekbone, and then it swings into like a C shape into the temples. Make sure you blend it, so it doesn’t look that obvious.”
Ms. Barnes has also been using maximum blush and taking inspiration from the ’70s and ’80s, extending color over the eye socket and sweeping it up toward the temples. “You can use the same shade over your entire lid or wash the blush over your usual eye shadow, either way works,” she said.
Ms. Hughes has been taking an equally retro approach, sweeping blush over the eyes and brow instead of doing a complicated eye makeup look. “I think of it like a soft little accent in an ’80s kind of way, all the way up into the eye and the brow,” she said.
Opt for Monochromatic Themes
Another modern touch for those who aren’t blush averse: Choose your blush and coordinate the rest of your makeup look to it. “Pick whatever your color is, and make the blush and everything else match,” said Ms. Hughes, who recently experimented with a bright pink style. “Then just do loads of lashes. It’s so chic and simple but impactful because it’s harmonious.”
Mix and Match Your Colors
The great thing about blush is that choosing the right color isn’t hard, and the new style of blush favors the bold. Chiao Li Hsu, another makeup artist, said that there are no rules when it comes to color, and she works with neon yellows or vivid reds when applying blush over the apples of the cheeks and up into the eye sockets.
“You can use any color,” Ms. Hsu said. She is also a fan of using draping techniques, taking deeper pinks and reds under the eyesand over the cheeks.
“It’s fun to play with several shades and textures of pink to make a monochromatic look more exciting and to add a bit of depth,” she said.
Other makeup artists like to mix multiple colors to get a custom look. “Enhance your bone structure by using a tone a couple of shades darker than your skin tone, mixed with a nude hue,” Ms. Barnes said.
Choose a Texture, and a Tool
Today’s blushes come in many textures — cream, powder, liquid. When wearing a mask, a liquid tint that dries down is the most transfer-proof option. But you can also use blush to change the texture of your complexion overall.
“Cream is great for dry skin,” Ms. Barnes said. “And powder for oily skin as a rule, but it’s personal preference. Natural makeup works well with creams, but with powder you can be more direct on where you place it, and it tends to last longer.”
Ms. Linter prefers to play with multiple textures. “You can wear both textures at once and layer,” she said. But the tool is just as important as the texture you choose. Opt for a sponge when using creams; fingers work fine with liquids; and use a brush for powders.
“Brushes are very, very important,” she said. “Some big, soft brushes are very ineffective. They don’t do anything. For blush, you need to have a pretty full-sized brush, but it needs to be a little on the firm side so that when you hit your skin, it controls the powder and keeps it so you can spread it correctly in the right place.”
Blend, but Not Too Much
Blending is the key to making blush modern, but not so much that you overdo it and lose the color.
“If I’m watching people put makeup on and they’re not fans of blush, I can always tell because they’ll apply it and then ferociously rub it in,” Ms. Hughes said. “What ends up happening is they rub it off as they’re blending it in. Just pick up a tiny bit, apply it slowly. You shouldn’t see the payoff immediately. You should see it gradually.”
At the end of the day, however, Ms. Hughes cautions that there are really no strict rules with blush. “If you like an actual cheek moment, do it,” she said. “If you like a high-up-into-the-temples moment, you should do that. Experiment to see what you like.”

NEW YORK — Justin Myers, a veteran data journalist whose work has driven some of the top investigative stories done by The Associated Press in recent years and has helped spearhead automation initiatives across its global newsroom, has been promoted to the position of data editor for the news cooperative.
In this role, he will manage the data analysts on the data team and oversee the team’s data-driven collaborations with reporters and editors across AP and its partner news organizations.
“Justin’s proven ability to manage complex data-driven projects and turn editorial ambition into technical and journalistic achievement is what AP needs to push its data journalism forward,” said Troy Thibodeaux, the AP’s data science and news applications editor.
Myers joined the data team five years ago as AP’s first automation editor. In that position, he worked with teams across AP to find ways to take repetitive work out of the way and help AP’s journalists focus on the journalism.
Myers led the 2018 automation efforts around VoteCast, creating both text and graphics that could be produced at the push of a button. He has also provided data analysis and engineering on some of AP’s biggest investigative and technology projects, including the large-scale investigation into abusive priests from 2019 and Russian hacking from 2017.
He also helped spearhead AP’s data team’s move to the cloud, creating a more robust infrastructure for news applications and a toolkit for big data analysis used in the 2020 election.
Myers is currently part of a group of AP journalists across the world who act as “inclusion champions,” ensuring that the company’s journalism contains voices from all corners of society and serves a variety of audiences.
Myers is a 2011 graduate of the University of Missouri with dual degrees in electrical engineering and journalism and a minor in math. Before joining AP, he was a news interactives producer at The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Before that, he was a news developer with PBS NewsHour.
He begins his new role immediately.
“Justin has led by example since his first day at AP. His diligence, integrity, ingenuity and generosity to colleagues have made everyone around him better,” Thibodeaux said. “I can’t wait to see what he does in the new role.”

The GameStop saga feels like class warfare, and it's far from over

None of this could have happened 30 years ago, in pre-internet times. A group of small investors on a subreddit called r/WallStreetBets banded together to buy stock in gaming retailer GameStop. They hoped that together they could elevate the stock price so that short sellers, including hedge funds and institutional investors, would ultimately lose money.
Social media analytics firm Talkwalker says that chatter around GameStop began on Reddit in mid-January, and the increasing mentions since correlate with rising share price. GameStop stock began the year at $17.25, began rising in mid-January to hit $347.51 on January 27. The r/WallStreetBets investors, who used retail trading apps such as Robinhood and Webull to buy the stock, were making money and having fun sticking it to the Wall Street establishment investors, who were losing money on their short sales.
"It's super easy for a bunch of 25-year-olds to transfer $200 from their bank account to buy some GameStop stock, and the trades are free," says Scott Tranter, the CEO of 0ptimus, a political data science firm that has provided market intelligence to hedge funds. "It's like playing a video game on your phone."
The same gang-buying behavior began to spread to other stocks. The prices of stocks such as American Airlines, AMC, Blackberry, Best Buy and Tootsie Roll began rising as more small buyers bought in.
On Thursday, Wall Street appeared to be closing ranks to slow down the rebellion. Robinhood, which offers free stock trades but makes millions selling trading data to hedge funds and institutional investors, said it was pausing sales of GameStop and 11 other stocks through its app. Brokerage houses began placing guardrails around buys of GameStop. The trading apps M1, Webull, and Public did the same, but all three said they were forced to do so because the clearing house they use, Apex, made it more expensive to process buys. Later Thursday, all three announced that they'd made agreements with Apex to allow the buying and selling of GameStop shares. Robinhood, which has its own clearing house, said it would resume buying of GameStop and other affected stocks on Friday.
Hedge funds are among the most destructive enterprises on Wall Street, often creating self-fulfilling prophecies of business failure that cause thousands to lose jobs while the traders and managers rake in big bucks. Moral of all of this: Hedge funds need much tighter regulation.
- Robert Reich (@RBReich) January 28, 2021
But the damage was done. The Empire struck back. GameStop stock lost 44% of its value during regular trading hours Thursday, closing down $152 at $193.60. Short sellers at least cut their losses, and r/WallStreetBets investors lost market value in their shares.
Naturally, the r/WallStreetBets traders were furious. "They have their Robinhood accounts where trades are free, and they thought this was a free market economy, and as soon as they make some money, all of a sudden this app stops them from making money and then these people go bonkers," says Tranter.
The whole affair has the look and feel of class warfare, as many pointed out on Twitter.
"These GameStop traders don't distinguish between hedge funds and the big banks that got bailed out after the 2008 crisis, and the banks that are screwing them on student loans, mortgage rates, and bank fees," Tranter says. "These traders think it's all just these rich people who rig the system and operate under a different set of rules when things don't go their way-like with these GameStop trades."
The strength of the r/WallStreetBets investors is in their numbers. Individually, they can play with much less money and much less risk.
If the stock price goes down, they're only out a couple hundred dollars and can go to sleep knowing they did their part to stick it to The Man. They're just buying and selling stocks. Few if any hold enough money in reserve to play the extremely risky short-sell game the hedge funds and institutional investors play.
But the cumulative effect of their actions is large, and a real threat to big funds.
This is unacceptable.
We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.
As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I'd support a hearing if necessary. https://t.co/4Qyrolgzyt
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 28, 2021
The GameStop stock will eventually return to a price more in line with the real value of the company, but the hedge funds don't have the luxury to wait. They have to close out their short-sell options every Friday. If the GameStop stock remains high on Friday, the big funds will be on the hook to pay for all the options they bought on the belief the stock would go down. That could cost millions.
Many of the r/WallStreetBets investor group say they plan to hold their GameStop positions at least until tomorrow. One large hedge fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly had to take an emergency loan to cover the cost of losses it took from short selling GameStop stock.
Robinhood's halt on stock buys Thursday may have been good for the big funds, but not everybody agrees it was the right thing to do. One thing is clear: gang investing is legal and isn't going to go away. Will Robinhood suddenly halt trading on certain stocks when this happens again?
The whole situation has attracted the attention of lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and some are calling for Congressional hearings. The White House has said it is watching the situation closely.
"This . . . showed how the cards are stacked against the little guy in favor of billionaire Wall Street Traders, said Rep. Ro Khanna in a statement Thursday. "While retail trading in some cases, like on Robinhood, blocked the purchasing of GameStop, hedge funds were still allowed to trade the stock. We need more regulation and equality in the markets."

Nashville, Tennessee-based Emids has acquired Macadamian, a Gatineau, Quebec-based healthcare software design and development consultancy. No financial terms were disclosed. Emids, a provider of digital engineering and transformation solutions to the healthcare and life sciences industry, is backed by New Mountain Capital.

PRESS RELEASE

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--emids, a leader in digital engineering and transformation solutions to the healthcare and life sciences industry, today announced another step in its purposeful growth strategy, this time adding global design-led software engineering capabilities through the acquisition of Macadamian, one of the largest and most respected healthcare specialist firms of its kind in the world. Terms of the deal, which closed earlier this month, were not disclosed.

emids has a strong track record of delivering complex solutions to its clients using its deep engineering and applications capabilities. The addition of Macadamian’s design-first capabilities is a perfect complement and will help both emids and Macadamian customers work with a single partner that brings in great depth and breadth in domain, design and engineering.

“Our customers have accelerated both their timelines and their investments in digital and virtual health solutions focusing on patients in the wake of COVID-19, and our acquisition of Macadamian very eloquently delivers the added sophistication that our payer, provider and life sciences partners need and demand when bringing to market digital solutions to transform the healthcare experience,” said emids Founder and CEO Saurabh Sinha. “Design has become an embedded part of the transformation value chain, and we were immediately struck by Macadamian’s design-first approach, its patented IP and innovations Lab and its sheer depth and breadth in the healthcare space.”

The Macadamian acquisition expands emids’ global employee footprint to more than 2,300, with 109 expert designers, developers and engineers in Canada and Eastern Europe. Macadamian’s clients run the gamut from early-stage to Fortune 500 companies with a heavy concentration in biopharmaceuticals and medical devices. Macadamian further expands emids’ IP, centers of excellence and platform capabilities, including its HealthConnectTM application development platform as a service, which has proven a powerful underlying architecture to accelerate the development of data-informed medical devices and digital therapeutic software applications for clients.

Macadamian CEO Frederic Boulanger said: “Our merger with emids is a superior match of entrepreneurial mindset, complementary skill sets and healthcare specialization, and we’re excited about what we’ll be able to achieve together for our customers and for healthcare at large.”

Dinesh Kandanchatha, Macadamian COO, said the key to delivering digital solutions that people need to live healthier lives or that providers need to deliver better care is to focus on people first and the technology second.

“The technology dictates how digital solutions get delivered, but it takes a design thinking approach to first figure out what people need so that we can match those needs with what’s technologically viable and valuable to customers and to the market,” Kandanchatha said. “We look forward to joining forces with emids to further scale the successful integration of data science, human-centered design and development to bring big ideas to life.”

Kumar Kolin, emids Chief Technology Officer, said the addition of the Macadamian team and its superior capabilities catapults emids’ standing in the space at a critical inflection point in healthcare’s digital transformation.

“Experience tells us that the greatest value we can bring to our customers and to consumers of healthcare – which is all of us – is to solve problems, remove the friction and improve the care experience for everyone involved,” Kolin said. “We believe in the power and the promise of design thinking and design-led engineering, and while design thinking is in no way a new philosophy, it’s certainly a philosophy and an approach whose time has finally come full circle for healthcare.”

NFL's 1st & Future to award $150,000 on television show

The NFL is bringing its awards for novel advancements in athletes’ safety and performance to television.
Next Tuesday night during Super Bowl week, the league will air its sixth annual “1st & Future” competition. The show is set for 8 p.m. EST on NFL Network. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Arizona Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald and Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, which is collaborating with the league, will be on hand as $150,000 in prize money is handed out on the telecast.
Innovators and data scientists have been awarded a total of $750,000 for their winning pitches in past years.
“The 1st & Future program has grown substantially over the last few years as a direct result of the fact that we have been able to attract innovative ideas and actual products that have translated to the NFL field relatively quickly,” said Jeff Miller, the league’s executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy.
Some real-world examples of 1st & Future winners’ impact:
— Mobile Virtual Player (MVP) is a company started by Dartmouth football coach Buddy Teevens that invented a robotic tackling dummy which reduces tackling in practice. Teevens believed “there was a better way to replicate the needs of the game if we can get something that simulates movement on a field, be fast enough, thick enough, heavy enough to strike, but not jeopardize the person making the tackle or the person being tackled. That’s how it started.”
MVP is used by more than half of the 32 NFL teams and hundreds of college, high school and youth football programs, according to its website.
“Something that is relatively simple or translatable to a football field was able to come out of it because the platform existed for them to showcase it and get some funding to help them increase business,” Miller said.
— Impressio, which is working to redesign how inter-liners of football helmets work. The company developed new, high-energy absorbing materials used in protective equipment to make customized helmets not only for the player but for his position, and to increase the performance of the helmet during a collision. The material has applications to other sports, to the military and beyond.
“We were a startup company that had only been incorporated a few months (before 1st & Future), said Impressio President and CTO Chris Yakacki. “We were virtually unknown before the competition. And then the next thing you know, NASA is calling.”
There are two categories in the 1st & Future competition. The “innovations” category features four start-ups pitching projects designed to improve player health and safety to a panel of judges made up of doctors, athletic trainers, engineering experts, venture capitalists and former players. Winners will be awarded $50,000 and $25,000 for the grand and runner-up prizes, respectively.
The “computer vision” category, held via the data science platform Kaggle, has five winners to be unveiled during the TV show who will split $75,000. The NFL provided computer scientists actual game data and challenged them to create ways to detect on-field helmet impacts. Nearly 7,800 submissions from 55 countries were received.
Successful computer vision models of helmet contacts will inform rules changes, teaching tools and even future helmet designs.
“The program has grown in multiple different directions as a result of our ability to see the possibilities that exist,” Miller said. “Innovation from different sources is a fabulous way for us to be able to help solve problems that we have. This platform allows us to attract people who would not otherwise work to the benefit of football and to apply their ideas to exactly those set of issues that we want to help solve.
“Take a computer scientist or materials scientist who is out there working on some new innovation or breakthrough and for them to be able to discover that the NFL as one possible source for application of what they are working on has substantial benefit to us.”
This year’s finalists for innovations are Genesis Helmets, Inc. of Keystone Heights, Florida; Nix, Inc. of Boston; Organic Robotics Corporation (ORC) of Ithaca, New York; and PEEP Performance, LLC of Houston.
Genesis Helmets is seeking to develop a better-performing football helmet focused on the brain rather than the skull. Nix generates real-time data on sweat rate and electrolyte losses to empower athletes to maintain proper hydration. ORC’s sensors use light to measure muscle fatigue and respiration. PEEP Performance’s GO  Device is a breathing device that increases the user’s blood oxygen levels while providing the protection of a traditional mouth guard.
“It’s very much Day 1 in applying machine learning to uncover previously unknown insights in sports,” said Priya Ponnapalli, senior manager and principal scientist at the Amazon Machine Learning (ML) Solutions Lab at AWS. “I’m optimistic about the materially beneficial impact this sophisticated technology can provide to athletes, managers, sportscasters, fans and more.”

Ascent, which is backed by Horizon Capital, has acquired UK-based Mango Solutions, a data science consulting firm. No financial terms were disclosed.

PRESS RELEASE

LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ascent, a UK software strategy and development firm, has acquired award-winning* Mango Solutions, one of the UK’s largest data science consulting firms, as it vies for a bigger slice of the fast-growing market for data science, advanced analytics, data engineering, and IoT (Internet of Things) solutions.

Although financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the acquisition is expected to add 65 employees and approximately £5M in annual revenues to Ascent. Prior to the acquisition both companies were close business partners. The combined business will employ more than 340 people.

Ascent is backed by private equity house Horizon Capital and led by CEO Stewart Smythe. Ascent had previously invested £30M less than 12 months ago, which was used for earlier acquisitions. Smythe confirmed he has access to significant additional funding as required to deliver the Ascent plan.
Commenting on the deal Smythe said: “We’ve enjoyed a proven working relationship with Mango Solutions for some time now, and are so confident in the quality of their work and their people that we decided to make the partnership permanent.

“Achieving business strategy goals in mid and upper-mid market customers now requires ambidextrous, integrated software and data capabilities to deliver effective digital transformation. Companies that can achieve this will do better than their competitors, grow more quickly and see exponential commercial gain. Delivering long-term value to these businesses demands extensive expertise in advanced analytics and data science techniques like statistical modelling and machine learning; exactly the sort of deep capability that Mango Solutions brings to the table. We expect the combined businesses to deliver organic growth in the region of 20 percent annually.”

Smythe estimates that more than 80 per cent of new businesses coming to Ascent for help in 2020 had requirements that escalated rapidly from software into data analytics and modelling. The acquisition of Mango Solutions means that Ascent is now well placed to design and deliver integrated ‘big picture’ digital strategies for businesses looking to do something new, do something better, or both.

Smythe says that Covid-19 has also been another factor driving demand in recent months. Many European businesses have rapidly pivoted to prioritise digital experience, which requires deep insight into customer needs, habits and behaviours to successfully extend their relationship online, or convert them from other channels. This requires extensive blending of front end, customer-facing online capabilities with commercially-driven data analytics, modelling and insights.

Rich Pugh, Chief Data Scientist at Mango Solutions, will continue in this role at Ascent. Regarded as one the UK’s leading data experts, Pugh will help champion Ascent’s newly-acquired ability to deliver advanced analytics and data science to a much broader customer base. Rich will continue to be a leading authority in the data science community across Europe. Pugh also believes that both businesses share a passion for equipping customers with new capabilities to build digital muscle and make better decisions.

Pugh said: “The most exciting thing about joining Ascent is that we will see our vision and expertise become accessible to so many more businesses so much sooner. What was once the domain of only the largest enterprises is now accessible to the mid and upper-mid market – at a time when demand for insight and intelligence is surging. Ascent is the accelerant to take Mango’s capability and leadership in data science to this broader market.”

Smythe added: “The vast majority of boards now believe that there is huge value in understanding and exploiting the data that they have in their businesses, and that extracting this value is an immediate priority for them. It is no longer seen as the preserve of large multinational or niche sub sector businesses.”

Simon Hitchcock, Managing Partner at Horizon Capital, concluded: “Mango is the third acquisition we have made with Ascent since our investment in the business 12 months ago. These acquisitions have enhanced the impressive organic growth of the business under Stewart Smythe’s leadership and are creating a market leader in the digital transformation market. We’re looking forward to welcoming the Mango Solutions team to Ascent and see their data capabilities as a core part of the business going forward. We look forward to supporting Ascent in further acquisitions of founder-led, technically brilliant businesses with strong cultures like Mango.”

Facebook was going to compete with Google for some advertising sales but backed away from the plan after the companies cut a preferential deal, according to court documents.
In 2017, Facebook said it was testing a new way of selling online advertising that would threaten Google's control of the digital ad market. But less than two years later, Facebook did an about-face and said it was joining an alliance of companies backing a similar effort by Google. 
  Facebook never said why it pulled back from its project, but evidence presented in an antitrust lawsuit filed by 10 state attorneys general last month indicates that Google had extended to Facebook, its closest rival for digital advertising dollars, a sweetheart deal to be a partner.
  Details of the agreement, based on documents the Texas attorney general's office said it had uncovered as part of the multistate suit, were redacted in the complaint filed in federal court in Texas last month. But they were not hidden in a draft version of the complaint reviewed by The New York Times.
  Executives at six of the more than 20 partners in the alliance told The Times that their agreements with Google did not include many of the same generous terms that Facebook received and that the search giant had handed Facebook a significant advantage over the rest of them.
  The executives, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their business relationships with Google, also said they had not known that Google had afforded such advantages to Facebook. The clear disparity in how their companies were treated by Google when compared to Facebook has not been previously reported.
  The disclosure of the deal between the tech giants has renewed concerns about how the biggest technology companies band together to close off competition. The deals are often consequential, defining the winners and losers in various markets for technology services and products. They are agreed upon in private with the crucial deal terms hidden through confidentiality clauses.
  Google and Facebook said that such deals were common in the digital advertising industry and that they were not thwarting competition.
  Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman, said the complaint ''misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business.'' She added that Facebook is one of many companies that participate in the Google-led program and that Facebook is a partner in similar alliances with other companies.
  Christopher Sgro, a Facebook spokesman, said deals like its agreement with Google ''help increase competition in ad auctions,'' which benefits advertisers and publishers. ''Any suggestion that these types of agreements harm competition is baseless,'' he said. Google and Facebook declined to elaborate on the specifics of their deal.
  The Wall Street Journal had reported on aspects of the draft complaint earlier.
  The swell of recent antitrust cases filed against Google and Facebook has cast a spotlight on lucrative deals among Big Tech. In October, the Justice Department sued Google and homed in on an agreement with Apple to feature Google as the preselected search engine on iPhones and other devices.
  ''This idea that the major tech platforms are robustly competing against each other is very much overstated,'' said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. ''In many ways, they reinforce each other's monopoly power.''
  Google and Facebook accounted for more than half of all digital advertising spending in 2019. In addition to displaying advertising on their own platforms, such as Google's search engine and Facebook's home page, websites, app developers and publishers rely on the companies to secure advertising for their pages.
  The agreement between Facebook and Google, code-named ''Jedi Blue'' inside Google, pertains to a growing segment of the online advertising market called programmatic advertising. Online advertising pulls in hundreds of billions of dollars in global revenue each year, and the automated buying and selling of ad space accounts for more than 60 percent of the total, according to researchers.
  In the milliseconds between a user clicking on a link to a web page and the page's ads loading, bids for available ad space are placed behind the scenes in marketplaces known as exchanges, with the winning bid passed to an ad server. Because Google's ad exchange and ad server were both dominant, it often directed the business to its own exchange.
  A method called header bidding emerged, in part as a workaround to reduce reliance on Google's ad platforms. News outlets and other sites could solicit bids from multiple exchanges at once, helping to increase competition and leading to better prices for publishers. By 2016, more than 70 percent of publishers had adopted the technology, according to one estimate.
  Seeing a potentially significant loss of business to header bidding, Google developed an alternative called Open Bidding, which supported an alliance of exchanges. While Open Bidding allows other exchanges to simultaneously compete alongside Google, the search company extracts a fee for every winning bid, and competitors say there is less transparency for publishers.
  The threat of Facebook, one of the biggest ad buyers on the internet, supporting header bidding was a grave concern at Google. The draft of the complaint reviewed by The Times cited an email from a Google executive calling it an ''existential threat'' that required ''an all hands on deck approach.''
  Facebook announced in March 2017 that it was testing header bidding with publishers like The Washington Post, Forbes and The Daily Mail. Facebook also took a jab at Google, saying the digital ad industry had been handing over profits to ''third-party middlemen who make the rules and obfuscate the truth.''
  Before Google and Facebook signed the deal in Sept. 2018, Facebook executives outlined the company's options to Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, according to the draft of the complaint: hire hundreds more engineers and spend billions of dollars to compete against Google; exit the business; or do the deal.
  To many in the ad industry, Facebook joining Google's alliance felt like a reversal on header bidding. One Open Bidding partner said it had been excited to be in discussions with Facebook about setting up an alternative to Google's alliance only to have conversations abruptly cease in 2018.
  Facebook disclosed that it had joined Google's program in one line in a Dec. 2018 blog post. But it did not reveal that Google, according to the draft complaint, provided Facebook with special information and speed advantages to help the company succeed in the auctions that it did not offer to other partners -- even including a guaranteed ''win rate.''
  In this market, where fractions of a second count, a speed advantage was decisive. Facebook had 300 milliseconds to bid for ads, according to court documents. But the executives at Google's partner companies said they usually had just 160 milliseconds or less to bid.
  Facebook had yet another advantage: Direct billing relationships with the sites where ads would appear, according to the court documents. For most other partners, Google controlled pricing information, effectively putting up a wall between Open Bidding participants and site owners and hiding how much of winning bids sites end up receiving, the executives at other companies said.
  Google agreed to help Facebook have a better understanding of who would be shown the ads by helping the company identify 80 percent of mobile users and 60 percent of web users, the documents said. But several other partners said they had little such help understanding who was being shown ads.
  Adam Heimlich, the chief executive of Chalice Custom Algorithms, a marketing and data science consulting company, said the deal gave Facebook so much advantage that it was like allowing the social network to ''start every tournament in the finals.''
  Facebook promised to bid on at least 90 percent of auctions when it could identify the end user and committed to spending a certain amount of money -- as much as $500 million a year by the fourth year of the agreement, according to the draft of the complaint. Facebook also demanded that data about its bids not be used by Google to manipulate auctions in its own favor, a level playing field not explicitly promised to other Open Bidding partners.
  Perhaps the most serious claim in the draft complaint was that the two companies had predetermined that Facebook would win a fixed percentage of auctions that it bid on.
  ''Unbeknown to other market participants, no matter how high others might bid, the parties have agreed that the gavel will come down in Facebook's favor a set number of times,'' the draft complaint said. A Google spokeswoman said Facebook must make the highest bid to win an auction, just like its other exchange and ad network partners.
  While both companies said that the deal is not an antitrust matter, they included a clause in the agreement that requires the parties to ''cooperate and assist'' each other if they are investigated for competition concerns over the partnership.
  ''The word 'antitrust' is mentioned no less than 20 times" throughout the agreement, the draft complaint said.

Nondenominational “spiritual companions” offer to connect clients to the divine in their everyday life.
Last spring, after a divorce, Qadeera Ingram needed someone to talk to. Specifically, she wanted to be able to speak about spirituality and the bigger picture of her life.
Though Ms. Ingram, a 33-year-old government contractor in Goose Creek, S.C., is Christian, she isn’t a member of a church. So she hired Susan Pannier-Cass, a spiritual director and ordained minister, to talk about what she was experiencing, including raising her 6-year-old son in a pandemic at a time of widespread unrest.
In some of the virtual sessions, Ms. Ingram talked about her dreams, and Ms. Pannier-Cass would help her analyze them. In others, Ms. Ingram discussed elements of the natural world, how they made her feel closer to God. Ms. Pannier-Cass would encourage her “to go outside more and take my shoes off,” Ms. Ingram said, “put my feet on the ground, just to reconnect with my center and what brings me peace.”
Spiritual companions, also known as spiritual directors, are guides whose purpose is to listen deeply to clients and help them explore their spirituality, usually in a nondenominational capacity.
What they offer is not therapy; according to Spiritual Directors International, a nonprofit in Bellevue, Wash., the goal of meeting with a spiritual companion is to take a “meaningful step to help you find wholeness and balance in life, not to mention a sense of connection with however you might refer to God, Allah, The Universe, or the Ground of All Being, that which connects us all.”
The practice has roots in many faiths, particularly the Jesuit branch of Catholicism, but contemporary spiritual directors come from a variety of religions.
“Most people come to spiritual direction looking for ultimate meaning, however they might define it. We don’t define it for them,” said Seifu Anil Singh-Molares, a Zen Buddhist priest and the executive director of Spiritual Directors International. (While spiritual direction is the more familiar term, he said, he favors “spiritual companion” because it is more inclusive.) “We support you in finding your own way to God, if that’s how you describe it, or Brahman, or Tao.”
Space for Seeking
“Spiritual but not religious” is how 27 percent of Americans define themselves, according to a Pew Research Center survey from 2017. But one-quarter of American adults in an April survey from Pew reported that their religious faith has increased because of the pandemic.
For some seeking spiritual connection, this results in a hybrid approach. Alissa Ballot, 65, another of Ms. Pannier-Cass’s clients and a retired lawyer in Chicago, was already a member of a synagogue when a retreat introduced her to spiritual companionship. She has found greater self-understanding by writing poetry at Ms. Pannier-Cass’s suggestion, she said. Spiritual direction is helping her “become the me that God intended and created me to be.”
Lucinda Clark, a spiritual director in Charlotte, N.C., said that in her experience, more Black clients, including clergy members, are seeking spiritual direction after George Floyd’s death and the anger and protests that followed.
“That has been one of the main issues,” said Ms. Clark, 51. “‘How can I operate and work in my ministry in an environment that is unknowingly sometimes rejecting me and sometimes knowingly?’ And so, some people are coming because they’re hurt. They don’t know how to move forward.”
Ms. Clark, who completed a three-year spiritual direction program at Charlotte Spirituality Center, became a spiritual director after what she describes as “a dark night of the soul” in which she questioned certain ideologies in her church. She concluded that while she is rooted in Christianity, there are many paths to God.
Afterward, “I just knew that I needed to journey with other people, to partner with other people, so they didn’t feel alone,” she said. “I thought, ‘I don’t know the name of this thing that I’m supposed to do. I just know that I’m supposed to do it.’”
When she came across spiritual direction in an internet search, “I was like, ‘That is it!’” she said. In her sessions, she often asks questions to help clients reflect on what they’re experiencing, from a hard day at work to a disconnection in their relationship with God.
Andrea Metz-Nicholson, 59, a spiritual director and one of Ms. Clark’s clients, believes the practice has given her greater self-awareness, an ability to voice difficult emotions, and a more intimate relationship with God. She has endured several family tragedies in recent years, and seeing Ms. Clark “just brought clarity,” Ms. Metz-Nicholson said. “It brought me peace.”
Others come to spiritual direction for guidance in reconciling their past faith with what they believe now, or merging their interfaith beliefs into a cohesive whole. “People are creating their own spiritual landscape,” said Summer Albayati, 51, a spiritual director in Orange, Calif., who describes herself as a Unitarian Universalist Muslim minister.
Rabbi Adam Lavitt, 38, in Providence, R.I., who provides spiritual direction for rabbinical students, a senior living community and individual clients, likes to bring creativity into his sessions through activities like art and writing. The more people take pleasure in the process, he said, “the easier it is for them to hear their life, their soul, speaking to them.”
Boundaries and Beyond
Spiritual directors, unlike therapists, are not licensed clinicians. They are not regulated by any agency. Nor does Spiritual Directors International, one of the biggest organizations dedicated to spiritual companionship, or smaller organizations like Spiritual Directors of Color Network, offer any kind of independent certification.
Training can vary depending upon the practitioner’s faith background or educational preferences, but there are certificate programs through spiritual direction organizations and nonprofit ministries, including the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Washington, D.C.
Spiritual Directors International’s guidelines call for spiritual directors to have directors themselves, and mentors or peers to provide supervision and accountability. Fees for spiritual direction typically run on a sliding scale, up to $150 per 50-minute session. Some directors offer pro bono services for those who can’t afford to pay.
The relationship between companion and seeker is an intimate one, and just as in any kind of counseling, it’s important for spiritual directors to maintain appropriate boundaries. Some spiritual companions, including Ms. Pannier-Cass, have degrees in social work.
Emily Malcoun, a clinical psychologist in Philadelphia who has worked with a spiritual director, noted that while therapy “can provide expert help with healing from mental health symptoms,” spiritual direction “focuses on your relationship with God or the divine” through prayer or reflection.
Some advocate for more accountability in the profession. Andree Grafstein, a spiritual director in Avon, Conn., described an incident of sexual harassment from a director about 40 years ago in an article she published last fall in Presence, a journal published by Spiritual Directors International. “I look forward to a day when the reality of a spiritual director’s sexual harassment becomes as visible as other forms of sexual abuse have become,” she wrote.
Since the article was published, Ms. Grafstein said she has received supportive emails from other spiritual directors. She is particularly concerned about the need to provide guidance and support for spiritual directors who learn that a directee has experienced harassment or abuse at the hands of another director.
Directees can be vulnerable, especially because, for some, rejection of organized religion or a former religious community is what brought them to a spiritual director in the first place. Kristabeth Atwood in Burlington, Vt., a spiritual director and former United Methodist minister, calls herself a pastor for people who don’t go to church. Most of her directees “just don’t resonate with being part of a traditional or formal religious community,” she said.
Others may be considering different denominations within their faith. Late last year Silas Bergen, 33, a statistics and data science professor at Winona State University in Winona, Minn., decided to leave his church after working with a friend who was training to be a spiritual director.
Mr. Bergen, who had previously played piano for his church and even helped lead worship services, began to feel more and more at odds with the church’s conservative beliefs and doctrine, though they were familiar to him from what he describes as his “evangelical-flavored” religious upbringing.
“I just began to feel this dissonance really strongly,” he said. Through what began as monthly virtual conversations in summer 2019, he explored what form of Christianity would be meaningful to him now. He plans to consider new churches when in-person visits are possible.
“Where have I been? Where am I at with whatever I’ve been experiencing?” Mr. Bergen said, describing his self-reflection process. “That encourages me to check in with myself, to maybe name the ways in which I’m noticing the divine in my everyday life.”

Nondenominational ''spiritual companions'' offer to connect clients to the divine in their everyday life.
Last spring, after a divorce, Qadeera Ingram needed someone to talk to. Specifically, she wanted to be able to speak about spirituality and the bigger picture of her life. 
  Though Ms. Ingram, a 33-year-old government contractor in Goose Creek, S.C., is Christian, she isn't a member of a church. So she hired Susan Pannier-Cass, a spiritual director and ordained minister, to talk about what she was experiencing, including raising her 6-year-old son in a pandemic at a time of widespread unrest.
  In some of the virtual sessions, Ms. Ingram talked about her dreams, and Ms. Pannier-Cass would help her analyze them. In others, Ms. Ingram discussed elements of the natural world, how they made her feel closer to God. Ms. Pannier-Cass would encourage her ''to go outside more and take my shoes off,'' Ms. Ingram said, ''put my feet on the ground, just to reconnect with my center and what brings me peace.''
  Spiritual companions, also known as spiritual directors, are guides whose purpose is to listen deeply to clients and help them explore their spirituality, usually in a nondenominational capacity.
  What they offer is not therapy; according to Spiritual Directors International, a nonprofit in Bellevue, Wash., the goal of meeting with a spiritual companion is to take a ''meaningful step to help you find wholeness and balance in life, not to mention a sense of connection with however you might refer to God, Allah, The Universe, or the Ground of All Being, that which connects us all.''
  The practice has roots in many faiths, particularly the Jesuit branch of Catholicism, but contemporary spiritual directors come from a variety of religions.
  ''Most people come to spiritual direction looking for ultimate meaning, however they might define it.

What are the leading causes of death for white and Black Americans? Why is there a gap in mortality rates? 
Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.
This graph shows the gap between Black and white mortality rates in 2018 for the top 15 causes of death in the United States. The horizontal axis shows the difference in mortality rates for each cause of death. The width of each bar represents the combined mortality rate for Black and white people. The mortality rates are expressed as deaths by cause per 100,000 people.
The graph appeared elsewhere on NYTimes.com.
By Friday morning, Jan. 22, we will reveal the graph’s free online link, additional background and questions, shout-outs for great student headlines, and Stat Nuggets.
After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:
• What do you notice? 
• What do you wonder? 
• What impact does this have on you and your community?
• What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.
The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. 
2. Next, join the conversation online by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box. (Teachers of students younger than 13 are welcome to post their students’ responses.)
3. Below the response box, there is an option for students to click on “Email me when my comment is published.” This sends the link to their response which they can share with their teacher.
4. After you have posted, read what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting a comment. Use the “Reply” button to address that student directly.
On Wednesday, Jan. 20, teachers from our collaborator, the American Statistical Association, will facilitate this discussion from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time.
5. By Friday morning, Jan. 22, we will reveal more information about the graph, including a free link to the article that included this graph, at the bottom of this post. We encourage you to post additional comments based on the article, possibly using statistical terms defined in the Stat Nuggets.
Reveal
We’ll post more information here on Thursday afternoon. Stay tuned!

The Reveal 
This graph appeared in the Aug. 16, 2020 opinion article “Racism’s Hidden Toll.” This graph shows the gap between Black and white mortality rates in 2018 for the top 15 causes of death. The horizontal axis shows the difference in mortality rates for each cause of death. The width of each bar represents the combined mortality rate for Black and white people. The mortality rates are expressed as deaths by cause per 100,000 people. The article has two other graphs that are other ways to show the mortality gap between Black and white people for the years 1900 to 2018.
What is the cause of these significantly different health outcomes? The New York Times article cites Jay Pearson, an assistant professor of public policy at Duke University, who says the difference in health outcomes cannot be completely explained by genetics, income, education and behavior. “What we’re really talking about is structural racism,” concludes Dr. Pearson. The article explains in more depth how researchers came to this conclusion.
These graphs only include data for 2018. Regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, the article states that “Black people are three times more likely than white people to contract the coronavirus, six times more likely to be hospitalized as a result and twice as likely to die of Covid-19.” Some reasons for this difference include that proportionately more Black people than white people have jobs that limit their ability to socially distance, live in overcrowded housing that may be closer to environmental hazards, and have more limited health care.
Study the graph. Read the article. Read some of the 274 comments, especially the Reader and NYT Picks. What do you think about the disparate health outcomes of Black and white people? What could be done about this?
Here are some of the student headlines that capture the story of these maps: “Inequality in Life, Inequality in Death” by Paul of Memphis and “Differences in Death Rates: The Race Gap” by IMEG of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
You may want to think critically about these questions:
• Learn more about the disparity in health between Black and white people by reading the article and examining its graphs. Also, read some of the 274 comments for The New York Times readers, especially the Reader Picks, NYT Picks and NYT Replies and the replies to these responses. What other insights about the gap between Black and white deaths do you have from these responses?
• This graph is a bar mekko chart. (See the below Stat Nugget.) Like a bar chart, the numerical value associated with each value of a categorical variable is represented by the length of the bar. But, there is a second variable that is represented by the width of the bar. The length and the width of the bars should be considered separately. The area of the bar has no meaning. For this graph, what does the length of the bar mean? What does the width of a bar mean? Explain what the heart disease bar tells you about mortality.
• Here is the data that was used for the heart disease bar.
• Number of white people: 197,000,000
• Number of Black people: 40,000,000
• Number of white people heart disease deaths: 333,000
• Number of Black people heart disease deaths: 83,000
What other type of graph could have been used to compare the impact heart disease has on Black and white people? Try a few different types of graph. Which best shows the overall death rate and the gap? Remember that the above graph uses data per 100,000 people.
• Learn more about the disparity of coronavirus deaths by race and ethnicity by reading the report “The Color of Coronavirus: Covid-19 Deaths by Race and Ethnicity in the U. S.” prepared by the APM Research Lab. What could be done to reduce this difference?
Next week’s graph on electric cars will be released by Friday, Jan. 22 with live-moderation on Wednesday, Jan. 27. You can receive the 2020-2021 “What’s Going On In This Graph?” schedule by subscribing here to the Learning Network Friday newsletter. Keep noticing and wondering.

Stat Nuggets for “Racism’s Hidden Toll”
To see the archives of all Stat Nuggets with links to their graphs, go to this index.
BAR MEKKO CHART
 A bar mekko chart is a bar chart with variable bar widths. Both bar charts and bar mekko charts show numerical values associated with the categories of a categorical variable. For a bar chart, the value is often (but not always) the frequency of occurrence in a categorical data set and the bars all have the same width. A bar mekko chart adds information on an additional variable that is represented by the width of the bars. The width of the bar shows the relative importance of each bar.
In the Mortality by Race graph, the categories are the top 15 causes of death. The two variables for each of the causes are the gap in the death rate between Black and white people per 100,000, represented by the bar length and the death rate for Black and white people per 100,000, represented by the bar width. The length of the heart disease bar shows that Black people have more than 40 deaths per 100,000 more than white people. The width of the bars clearly show that heart disease is the top cause of death. The area of the bars has no meaning. However, the order of their areas from largest to smallest, does show the relative number of deaths for each cause of death.
RATE
Rate is the count of some characteristic of a group divided by the total number of members in the group or the total value of a group. Rates can be expressed as percentages, decimals, fractions, or per capita values. Rates, rather numbers, are often used to make more meaningful comparisons between diverse groups.
In the Mortality by Race graph, the deaths by cause are expressed as rates rather than numbers. Because there are about 200 million white people but only about 40 million Black people, you would expect more white people deaths by cause. But if the deaths are converted to the number of deaths per 100,000 people, we can compare deaths for the same 100,000 population size. In addition, for this graph, rates are adjusted for age, so the two groups have the same age distribution.

The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney. Ms. Hessney wrote the “reveal” and Stat Nuggets with Roxy Peck, professor emerita, California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, and moderates online with Dashiell Young-Saver, a high school statistics teacher in San Antonio and data science graduate student at Harvard. He is the founder of Skew The Script, which provides relevant math and statistics curriculum to teachers.

This year, technology firms big and small stepped up to help with the Covid-19 pandemic and other thorny challenges.
Some years, I have to dig deep to come up with worthy honorees for the Good Tech Awards, my annual column that honors what I consider the most humane and altruistic tech projects of the year. 
  Not in 2020, though. This year, technology did more for us than ever -- helping us work from home, set up remote schools, communicate with our loved ones, organize for racial justice, protect the integrity of an election and keep the economy running during a pandemic. And all over the world, technologists stepped up to help solve critical problems and keep us safe.
  Plenty of large tech companies gave money to Covid-19 relief efforts, antiracism groups and other philanthropic causes. Others donated personal protective equipment from their corporate stockpiles, or built apps for contact tracing and other critical pandemic tasks.
  But there were less-heralded tech contributions that made a real difference this year, and the people behind them deserve credit. So let's give thanks to a few of the technologists who stepped up in 2020.
  To U.S. Digital Response, for pandemic-proofing our infrastructure.
  In March, as Covid-19 began spreading across the country, a group of tech workers assembled in Slack rooms and on Zoom calls to figure out how they could use their tech expertise to help with the crisis. The result was the U.S. Digital Response, now a network of over 6,000 coders, data scientists and researchers who are helping local and state governments respond to Covid-19.
  So far, the group -- which is led by Raylene Yung, a former Facebook and Stripe executive, and includes volunteers from most of Silicon Valley's biggest companies -- has taken on pro bono projects in dozens of states. It helped Pennsylvania's Health Department set up an online data dashboard to track the number of available hospital beds and ventilators. It helped Seattle health officials set up an online testing hub, and rebuilt a Kansas Department of Labor website that was used to file for unemployment benefits.
  Ideally, cities and states would have enough money and technical expertise to do these things themselves. But until that happens, we're lucky that the U.S.D.R. is stepping in to fill the gaps.
  To Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, for helping put out the fires.
  Because of climate change, we're probably in for many more wildfires like the ones that burned through the West Coast this summer, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. But in future years, we might be better equipped to deal with them thanks to tools like those made by Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, three start-ups that are trying to modernize the firefighter's outdated arsenal.
  Perimeter, a small start-up in the Bay Area, makes collaborative mapping and data-sharing software for emergency workers. Its founder, Bailey Farren, is the 24-year-old daughter of a retired fire captain and a paramedic. After she and her family were forced to evacuate during the 2017 Tubbs fire, she saw the need for a better communication system than the two-way radios and paper maps that emergency workers often used. Perimeter's app, which allows fire departments to share real-time evacuation routes and safety updates, is being tested in California cities including Palo Alto and Petaluma, and the company plans to expand to other states soon.
  Technosylva, another California start-up, makes predictive modeling software that allows fire departments to calculate where a fire is heading, how fast it's moving and what weather patterns might affect its path. Its software is used in nine states, and helped the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection predict the trajectory of wildfires this year, saving valuable time for those trying to extinguish the blazes.
  Ignis, created by a Nebraska company, Drone Amplified, is used for ''prescribed burns'' -- small fires purposely set in the path of a larger wildfire to steal its fuel. The system attaches to a drone, and drops small incendiaries known as ''dragon eggs'' from a safe height, at a much lower cost and personal risk than a helicopter. Ignis was used to battle fires in Colorado, California and Oregon this year, and recently struck a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.
  To Our Data Bodies and Data for Black Lives, for fueling tech's racial reckoning.
  When George Floyd was killed in May, lots of Silicon Valley tech companies raced to voice their support for racial justice. But many of those companies have continued to make products that put Black communities at risk -- whether it's through amplifying misinformation, deploying biased artificial intelligence or perpetuating racism in their work forces.
  This year, I've been more impressed by community-based efforts I've seen to support Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements using the tools of technology to hold institutions accountable. One of these efforts, Our Data Bodies, is an education project run by researchers and organizers in Los Angeles; Detroit; Charlotte, N.C.; and other cities. It has worked to teach communities of color how their personal data is collected and used by tech firms and government agencies. This year, it hosted virtual trainings for community organizers to teach them how to fight potentially harmful technologies like facial recognition.
  Another effort, Data for Black Lives, is a group of technologists and activists led by Yeshimabeit Milner who are using the tools of data science to empower Black communities. This year, the group compiled state-level data about the impact of Covid-19 on Black people, and it is in the early stages of putting together a nationwide database of technologies used by police departments, with evidence of how those technologies disproportionately harm Black people.
  To Frontline Foods, for feeding our health care heroes.
  Last spring, when hospitals were filling up with Covid-19 patients and restaurants were struggling to survive, Frank Barbieri and Ryan Sarver, two San Francisco tech veterans, and their friend Sydney Gressel, a nurse in the medical system of the University of California, San Francisco, came up with the idea of connecting hungry frontline health workers with local restaurants that badly needed more business. They began raising money and soliciting help from their networks in the tech community to send restaurant meals to health workers, and Frontline Foods was born.
  Today, Frontline Foods is part of World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit started by the chef José Andrés. It has raised more than $10 million, has hundreds of volunteers throughout the country coordinating meal drop-offs using tools like Slack and AirTable, and has served more than 500,000 meals to hospitals and clinics, while keeping many struggling restaurants busy and afloat.
  To Jackbox Games, for livening up my quarantine.
  I've always been a gamer, but 2020 was the year I needed games to escape the stressful and depressing reality of pandemic life. And of all the games I played, the simple, party-style games with friends and family over Zoom gave me the most joy. Many were made by Jackbox Games.
  Jackbox is best known for its ''party packs'' of games you can play remotely with groups. (I'm partial to Quiplash, in which you compete to come up with funny responses to prompts like ''The worst thing to hear during a massage.'') The company's pandemic-fueled boom -- it has more than doubled its user base this year -- may fade when we can all go outside and see our friends in person again. But it has been invaluable for my sanity this year.
  To the scientists developing Covid-19 vaccines, for getting us back to normal.
  The most important innovation of the year, by a mile, wasn't really ''technology'' in the conventional, Silicon Valley sense of the word. But make no mistake: The scientists at Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, the National Institutes of Health, and other pharmaceutical companies and research labs whose work led to the first approved Covid-19 vaccines are innovators of the highest order, and they probably did more to alleviate human suffering this year than all the app developers and hardware makers in the world combined.
  These scientists -- and the teams that supported them -- worked under enormous pressure and crushing deadlines to develop a new kind of mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus, guide it through clinical trials and get it out to the public in record time. The vaccines are a true triumph of science, and because of these people's hard work, hundreds of millions of Americans will get to spend some or most of 2021 hugging their relatives, reopening their businesses, traveling safely and doing all of the socially un-distant things that give us meaning and joy.

LODI, Calif. — In San Joaquin County, part of California’s vast Central Valley that produces most of the country’s fruits and vegetables, the coronavirus is spreading like a weed and the hospitals are running out of beds for the sickest patients.
San Joaquin is part of a 12-county region that on Saturday had 100% of its intensive care unit beds filled, the highest rate anywhere in California. And with cases continuing at an unprecedented rate, the death toll inevitably will grow, too.
A new stay-at-home order was imposed this week but it’s anybody’s guess whether it will have the intended consequence of finally changing enough people’s behavior to slow infections as a vaccine is rolled out.
“It’s been frustrating,” said Chuck Davis, CEO of data science company Bayesiant that tracks virus numbers for the county. “It’s like we see the train coming down the track and we’re telling people, and some people listen and get off the track and other people get on the track and start dancing.”
The virus has found a foothold in Lodi, a city of 68,000 on the county's northern rim. The birthplace of A&W Root Beer, Lodi is surrounded by vineyards that rely on Latino farmworkers.
On School Street, the city's picturesque retail and restaurant hub, sycamore leaves as big as your hand littered the sidewalk. In normal times, volunteers clear the leaves. But that stopped during the pandemic, and the leaves piled up, a subtle reminder of how things have changed.
More stark reminders are at the local hospital, where a second intensive care unit was created to handle patients. A team of 17 nurses arrives Monday so the hospital can begin accepting patients from some of the county's six other hospitals, all of which are at 100% capacity or more in ICU units.
Dr. Patricia Iris, medical officer for Adventist Health Lodi Memorial, said during the first surge of cases this year 75% of patients were Latino. The hospital interviewed 30 Latino families to find out why, discovering they didn't trust the hospital.
Things improved after Adventist partnered with Spanish-language TV and radio stations to educate people about wearing masks and social distancing.
But across the city, many residents still don't follow the rules, Iris said.
“People can't help themselves. They want to be near family," she said. “We don't have the same culture and the rigidity around following the guidance here than, for example, San Francisco. We need to educate, educate, as much as we can so we can get some relief.”
Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed a three-week stay-at-home order for the San Joaquin Valley. The order forced restaurants to only offer takeout and delivery, shuttered hair and nail salons, movie theaters and other businesses, and limited retailers to 20% capacity.
Pat Patrick, president and CEO of the Lodi Chamber of Commerce, signed a letter to Newsom, urging him to let businesses stay open.
“There’s just no rhyme or reason to some of these things and certainly no data,” he said.
Lodi Junction, a sprawling thrift store, is following the rules, only allowing a maximum of 30 customers and requiring masks and distancing. More than a dozen people were sampling the wares on Wednesday — a box set of Anthony Robbins self-help books, a $150 flat screen TV with no remote — as Bruce Hornsby sang “that’s just the way it is” over the speakers.
Roman Winter was browsing some shirts while wearing a mask. He’s a doctor of internal medicine at a Southern California hospital, but once worked in San Joaquin County and still has a house in Lodi. He was visiting for the first time in six months and thinks not much has changed.
“It’s busier out there now than it was before the whole thing started,” he said. “It doesn’t seem that anybody cares.”
But some things have changed on School Street, where most of the restaurants have closed their seating. Unable to eat inside, Ryan Breakfield and his girlfriend Erica Everett ate takeout in the bed of a pickup truck, calling it a “COVID date.”
“It’s just really weird. That’s the best way to put it,” he said.
Tucked between four restaurants is the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, where owner Jeanne Bria’s business model relies on diners walking past her temptations. But people aren’t thinking about dessert now when they walk to their cars with Styrofoam takeout containers. Bria said her business is down 60%.
She wears a mask and only allows one person or party in her store at a time. She said most people follow the rules, but added: “I would say 95% of the people that come in want to complain about it.”
“My problem is I don’t know who to believe,” she said. “You hear from different sources different information. And I almost think that the mental health and the frustration damage that’s being done is almost worse.”
Across town, Denis Xenos knows exactly who he believes — and it isn't Newsom. The owner of Denis' Country Kitchen has kept his restaurant open for dine-in customers despite the mandate, posting on Facebook that he has converted into a “private club." The membership fee is $1 per family.
The stunt attracted the attention of the county public health department, which called Xenos and told him the district attorney has been notified. Xenos said nothing has happened yet, and he is “just trusting the Lord.”
“I'm standing up for what our forefathers have died to give me," Xenos said, adding he is not requiring masks. “We’re open, letting everybody choose what they want."
Others have accepted the rules as necessary. Tom Hoffman, owner of Heritage Oak Winery, canceled his wine tastings and other events for the next three weeks, even though the holiday season is when he makes the most money.
Hoffman said he expects to survive the shutdown. But his business won't be the same.
“I don’t really look forward to standing in the tasting room with 14 people in there all breathing the same air. That doesn’t appeal to me anymore,” he said.

Here’s what’s happening Saturday with the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.:
THREE THINGS TO KNOW TODAY
— The nation’s first COVID-19 vaccine will begin arriving in states Monday morning, U.S. officials said. The government on Friday gave the final go-ahead to the shots needed to end an outbreak that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans.
— The U.S. hit another grim daily record Friday, recording 3,309 deaths related to COVID-19. That surpassed the previous one-day high of 3,124 deaths reported Wednesday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Friday also saw a new high in daily confirmed infections, with more than 231,000. That’s nearly 4,000 above the previous record set on Dec. 4.
— Officials in California hope that a three-week stay-at-home order imposed this week on the agricultural San Joaquin Valley will slow transmission in a 12-county area where 97% of intensive care hospital beds are occupied.
THE NUMBERS: The seven-day rolling average of deaths per day in the U.S. rose to 2,360, up from 1,477 at the end of November, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of new confirmed cases also has jumped, to 210,765 from 166,123 on Nov. 27.
QUOTABLE: "We see the train coming down the track and we’re telling people, and some people listen and get off the track and other people get on the track and start dancing.” — Chuck Davis, CEO of data science company Bayesiant, on trying to get people in California to take precautions to avoid transmission.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Many snowbirds who typically live in warm U.S. climates part of the year to escape harsh winters in places as far away as Canada are staying put this year because of the pandemic, causing another hit to American tourism.
ON THE HORIZON: Trucks are expected to roll out Sunday morning with shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine heading to nearly 150 distribution centers across the states. An additional 425 sites will get shipments Tuesday, and the remaining 66 on Wednesday.

Long Working Remotely, Company Shares Its Tips

Ultranauts has been developing creative ways to hire, manage and motivate a far-flung and diverse work force for seven years.
From her home in Beaverton, Ore., Jamie Davila leads a team of eight engineers in seven states for the technology start-up Ultranauts. Like millions of other people during these work-from-home times, she relies on popular communication tools like Zoom and Slack. 
  But Ms. Davila and Ultranauts also work remotely in ways that make them different from most companies. They follow a distinctive set of policies and practices to promote diversity and inclusion among employees.
  All video meetings have closed captioning, for workers who prefer to absorb information in text. Meeting agendas are distributed in advance so people who are uncomfortable speaking up can contribute in writing beforehand. Employees are asked daily for feedback, like whether they believe their strengths are valued and if they feel lonely at work.
  ''The whole idea is to create a safe space that allows everyone to be heard,'' Ms. Davila, 36, said.
  Ultranauts has been working for years on the challenges confronting so many companies during the pandemic, and probably beyond: how to effectively work remotely, make progress toward diversity and inclusion goals, and build a strong organizational culture.
  The company, founded in 2013 by two former roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a remote work force from Day 1. It was also founded to use the untapped talent of autistic people, who often think and process information differently from the rest of the population. Seventy-five percent of Ultranauts employees are on the autism spectrum.
  So the small start-up may offer lessons for corporate America in how to hire, manage and motivate far-flung employees, whose work and careers can suffer without the face time and hallway conversations of office life.
  ''Ultranauts' purposeful construction of a workplace that really supports people is extraordinary,'' said Susanne Bruyere, academic director of the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University. ''Its techniques and tools could absolutely be applied more broadly.''
  The start-up's customers include big companies like AIG, BNY Mellon and Cigna. It began with manual quality testing of websites and apps but has steadily moved to more advanced work like data-quality engineering, data analytics and automated software testing.
  When the pandemic hit, Ultranauts, which is based in New York, lost business as a couple of large customers made cuts to conserve cash. But it quickly picked up new work from companies that are accelerating digital projects despite the downturn. The business now has 90 employees, up from 60 a year ago. Its goal is to expand to 200 in two years.
  Ultranauts is backed by social-impact investors -- which seek financial returns, but not windfalls -- including The Disability Opportunity Fund, SustainVC, Wasabi Ventures and Moai Capital. They have invested $5.7 million so far.
  The company insists its work force is a competitive advantage. The edge, it says, is not so much that autistic brains are wired for computing tasks but that people on the autism spectrum are a diverse group.
  One person may recognize patterns quickly, while another has a more measured cognitive style but arrives at different patterns and ways to fix code. The key lies in harnessing the varied talents of teams.
  Meetings are recorded, transcribed and archived not only to accommodate workers who prefer reading to listening but also to foster a more open organization. That extends to the weekly meetings of the six-person leadership team at Ultranauts. The notes of those sessions, including the decisions made and reasons behind them, are published on the companywide Slack channel.
  ''It is a lot more transparency than most people in business are comfortable with,'' said Art Shectman, a co-founder and the company's president.
  Ultranauts' leaders believe their style of wide-open, explicit communication -- no unwritten rules -- could benefit any company. Ultranauts is giving away a valued homegrown software product, Biodex, as part of a test to see how widely its tools and practices might take root in the corporate mainstream.
  Each employee at Ultranauts has a Biodex profile that states the person's work, communication and feedback preferences. What is your typical response time to messages -- a few minutes, a few hours, same day? If a colleague has constructive criticism, how do you want to receive the feedback -- orally or in writing?
  Each morning, Biodex sends out a bot message with two questions: How ''interactive'' -- ready to communicate with others -- are you feeling today? What's your energy level today? Workers answer on a 1-to-10 scale.
  Rajesh Anandan, a co-founder and the chief executive of Ultranauts, describes Biodex as ''a quick-start guide for how to work with a person.''
  Ultranauts is letting teams at about a dozen organizations, from big corporations to start-ups, try out a test version of Biodex. If trial runs with outsiders go well, Ultranauts plans to make Biodex a free download on the Slack app store by the end of the year. Other Ultranauts apps, like its program for polling worker sentiment and well-being, would follow.
  ''We've built an engine that unlocks opportunity for people who haven't had a fair shot before,'' Mr. Anandan said. ''But if we only do that for ourselves, it won't have much of an impact.''
  Mr. Anandan is a former Bain consultant who switched gears and careers. In 2003, he went to work for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and later started an incubator for social ventures at UNICEF. Both he and Mr. Shectman, a software engineering consultant, had known since their M.I.T. days autistic people who struggled to find work.
  Many autistic people do well with the structured coursework of school, earning undergraduate and graduate university degrees. But they often stumble at the first hurdle into the job market -- the traditional job interview. They tend to struggle with social interaction, speaking informally and reading the nonverbal cues of communication.
  That was the case for Leslie Reis. She holds a master's degree in software engineering, but had not had a full-time job until Ultranauts hired her last year.
  Writing, Ms. Reis explained, is how she communicates best. ''For a lot of organizations, that was perceived as something that would be a drawback,'' she said in an email, ''rather than a way for me to participate more fully.''
  Ultranauts does not use work experience to filter job candidates. The company does conduct structured interviews, but hiring is largely based on skills assessments that it has developed to measure traits like the ability to work through new problems and take guidance and apply it. Work simulations are another test.
  Tulco, an investment firm in Pittsburgh, hired Ultranauts this year to do data-quality work. Tulco invests in traditional businesses that it thinks can become more efficient and profitable by applying data science and artificial intelligence, but creating those A.I. algorithms requires sifting through troves of messy data.
  Ultranauts' work has impressed Matthew Marolda, executive vice president for data science at Tulco. On one project, its team cleaned up and loaded a vast amount of information into an A.I. model with remarkable speed, days instead of weeks, he said.
  ''This is a work force with inherent strengths,'' Mr. Marolda said. ''They're really good at pattern recognition and really good at detail work.''
  Seeking new pools of skilled workers, and prodded by advocacy groups, several companies in recent years have begun programs to recruit and employ autistic workers, including SAP, Microsoft, Ernst & Young and JPMorgan Chase.
  Ultranauts is one of a handful of small companies and nonprofits in Europe and the United States that employ mainly autistic workers for jobs in technology. Others include Specialisterne, Auticon, Daivergent and Aspiritech. Ultranauts stands out, experts say, for working entirely remotely from the outset and for developing its carefully crafted combination of digital tools and workplace practices.
  Its culture has certainly resonated with Ms. Davila, who is autistic and was hired four years ago, with no formal training in computing. Since then, she has mastered not only programming languages but also skills as a manager.
  Ultranauts has also been her ladder to the middle class. ''Before I got the job at Ultranauts, I was on food stamps,'' Ms. Davila recalled. ''Now, I own my own house. And it's a nice house in a nice neighborhood.''

Palo Alto, California-based ConDati, a provider of next-generation analytics for digital marketing, has raised $4.75 million in Series A funding. The investors were not named.
PRESS RELEASE
PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 31, 2018 — conDati, a startup provider of next-generation analytics for digital marketing, today announced key milestones as the company also announced its flagship service, conDati Marketing Analytics. In addition to the product launch, the company has achieved significant traction with customers, hired a noted data scientist, and recently completed a $4.75 million Series A financing round.
Seasoned Startup Pros and Rock Star Data Scientists
Software industry veteran Ken Gardner started conDati to apply next-generation technology and data science to the Big Data problem in marketing caused by the proliferation of cloud-based martech. With a proven track record, including five prior startups with successful exits, Gardner is expert at creating new analytic products and bringing them to market. He was most recently founder and chairman of SOASTA, which was sold to Akamai (NYSE: AKAM) in April 2017.
conDati is the first platform to deliver a truly unified view of digital campaign performance. “We’re moving marketing out of manual data assembly and spreadsheet reporting into a new way to monitor, understand and manage digital marketing,” said Gardner, conDati CEO. “We’re delivering immediate visibility up and down the digital campaign hierarchy to help CMOs make decisions to improve business outcomes across paid search, email and social marketing.”
Among conDati’s other co-founders is Dan Bartow, serving as the company’s Vice President of Product Design and Engineering. Bartow is a multiple patent-holder in data science, analytics and UI. He served as SOASTA’s first Vice President of Products and Principal Product Designer until the company’s acquisition by Akamai.
The conDati executive team also now includes John Zicker, Chief Data Scientist, a world-class data scientist, five-time entrepreneur and three-time CEO. In the 1980s at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), Zicker built a control program that focused the electron particle stream in real time. This project relied heavily on machine learning and anomaly detection. “John’s work at SLAC using Big Data science in real time set new standards for what was possible,” Gardner commented. “Thirty years later, improvements in the economics of computing make these approaches usable for every business data problem.”
Successful Series A Financing
Earlier this month conDati completed its Series A financing, bringing the total round to $4.75 million. conDati’s backers include Silicon Valley veterans experienced in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science investments. These investors have successfully launched IPOs and positioned portfolio companies for acquisition by both private and public corporations.
Marketing Analytics Built In and for the Cloud
Digital marketing has evolved into a sophisticated set of tools, applications, systems and platforms that make up the martech stack. The stack typically includes standalone cloud-based systems for marketing automation, CRM, paid advertising, and social media. Each of these tools maintains its own data silo, so revenue, cost and activity data is scattered across the marketing department.
The debut of conDati Marketing Analytics addresses this problem by collecting campaign data in real time from each silo and delivering it to marketing leaders via intuitive, easily-navigated visualizations that show the financial performance of online marketing campaigns, including revenue roll-up, other goal conversions, and costs from multiple sources.
Built on a world-class cloud infrastructure that delivers 24/7/365 reliability and scalability, conDati leverages the economics of the cloud to give even small and mid-sized companies access to world-class, on-demand, affordable and actionable data science.
conDati collects data from the most important digital marketing sources that contain revenue, spend and activity, including Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Adwords, Bing Ads, DoubleClick, and Facebook Ads, as well as marketing automation systems including Salesforce Pardot, Cordial and Salesforce Marketing Cloud, to deliver complete visibility to revenue, costs and volume for digital campaigns. Once the data is combined, conDati’s machine learning algorithms build powerful predictive models that enable statistically valid forecasting and anomaly detection.
Driving Marketing ROI: Unified Data Achieves Rapid Customer Adoption
As the first cloud-based data science application to deliver the next generation of marketing analytics, conDati delivers a single unified data asset from siloed martech systems. conDati provides marketers with:
· Descriptive analytics – showing real-time financial and goal performance of an organization’s digital marketing campaigns, with the ability to compare campaigns to one another, across time periods, as well as the ability to drill down from the campaign summary level to individual campaigns.
· Predictive analytics – providing statistically-meaningful forecasts of future campaign performance, enabling anomaly detection and operational-level alerts. conDati also forecasts long-term revenue trends that give executives visibility into the need for potential strategic changes months in advance.
· Prescriptive analytics – a future release of conDati Marketing Analytics will provide recommendations for campaign spend levels and mix.
About conDati

When Algorithms Do the Grading

In-person final exams were canceled for thousands of students this spring, so computers stepped in -- to disastrous effect.
Isabel Castañeda's first words were in Spanish. She spends every summer with relatives in Mexico. She speaks Spanish with her family at home. When her school, Westminster High in Colorado, closed for the pandemic in March, her Spanish literature class had just finished analyzing an entire novel in translation, Albert Camus's ''The Plague.'' She got a 5 out of 5 on her Advanced Placement Spanish exam last year, following two straight years of A+ grades in Spanish class. 
  And yet, she failed her International Baccalaureate Spanish exam this year.
  When she got her final results, Ms. Castañeda was shocked. ''Everybody believed that I was going to score very high,'' she told me. ''Then, the scores came back and I didn't even score a passing grade. I scored well below passing.''
  How did this happen? An algorithm assigned a grade to Ms. Castañeda and 160,000 other students. The International Baccalaureate -- a global program that awards a prestigious diploma to students in addition to the one they receive from their high schools -- canceled its usual in-person final exams because of the pandemic. Instead, it used an algorithm to ''predict'' students' grades, based on an array of student information, including teacher-estimated grades and past performance by students in each school.
  Ms. Castañeda was not alone in receiving a surprising failing grade -- tens of thousands of International Baccalaureate students protested their computer-assigned grades online and in person. High-achieving, low-income students were hit particularly hard: many took the exams expecting to earn college credit with their scores and save thousands of dollars on tuition.
  Nor was the International Baccalaureate the only organization to use a computer program to assign students grades amid the pandemic. The United Kingdom's in-person A-level exams, which help determine which universities students go to, were also canceled and replaced with grades-by-algorithm. Students who were denied university entrance because of these imaginary grades took to the streets, chanting anti-algorithm slogans. Only after an uproar did the government change course, though many students were left in limbo without university admission.
  The lesson from these debacles is clear: Algorithms should not be used to assign student grades. And we should think much more critically about algorithmic decision-making overall, especially in education. The pandemic makes it tempting to imagine that social institutions like school can be replaced by technological solutions. They can't.
  The bureaucrats who decided to use a computer to assign grades are guilty of a bias I call technochauvinism: the idea that technological solutions are superior. It's usually accompanied by equally bogus notions like, ''Computers make neutral decisions'' or, ''Computers are objective because their decisions are based on math.''
  Computers are excellent at doing math, but education is not math -- it's a social system. And algorithmic systems repeatedly fail at making social decisions. Algorithms can't monitor or detect hate speech, they can't replace social workers in public assistance programs, they can't predict crime, they can't determine which job applicants are more suited than others, they can't do effective facial recognition, and they can't grade essays or replace teachers.
  In the case of the International Baccalaureate program, grades could have been assigned based on the sample materials that students had already submitted by the time schools shut down. Instead, the organization decided to use an algorithm, which probably seemed like it would be cheaper and easier.
  The process worked like this: Data scientists took student information and fed it into a computer. The computer then constructed a model that outputted individual student grades, which International Baccalaureate claimed the students would have gotten if they had taken the standardized tests that didn't happen. It's a legitimate data science method, similar to the methods that predict which Netflix series you'll want to watch next or which deodorant you're likely to order from Amazon.
  The problem is, data science stinks at making predictions that are ethical or fair. In education, racial and class bias is baked into the system -- and an algorithm will only amplify those biases.
  Crude generalizations work for Netflix predictions because the stakes are low. If the Netflix algorithm suggests a show and I don't like it, I ignore it and move on with my day. In education, the stakes are much higher. A transcript follows you for years; when I was 25 and well out of college, I applied for a job that asked for my SAT scores.
  In Ms. Castañeda's case, her failing grade was most likely due in part to the fact that historical performance data for her school was one of the inputs to the algorithm. The computer assumed that the students at Westminster, who are mostly low-income students of color, would continue to do poorly.
  ''Everyone I know got downgraded one or two levels,'' Ms. Castañeda told me. ''It's not fair that our scores were brought down because of our school's history. It's unfair to punish students for where they live.''
  Another input to the algorithm was teacher prediction of the students' grades. Teachers tend to have lower expectations for Black and Brown students compared to white students; this bias is well known in the education community and ignored in the data science community. Thus a very human bias prevailed in the computational system.
  International Baccalaureate and Ofqual, the agency that administers Britain's A-level exams, have reluctantly realized that algorithmic grades were a mistake. Since the outcry over algorithm-assigned grades, both organizations have been sued. Many students, including Ms. Castañeda, ended up receiving new, higher imaginary grades.
  Roger Taylor, chair of the Ofqual board, apologized in front of a House of Commons educational oversight committee this week. ''We are sorry for what happened this summer,'' he said. ''With hindsight it appears unlikely that we could ever have delivered this policy successfully.''
  As we stare down the fall semester online, there are going to be infinitely many technochauvinist calls to transform online education and use algorithmic tools that promise to evaluate individual student learning. Resist these calls.

Teladoc eyes several new phases of growth for telemedicine

Fresh off a big acquisition and riding a wave of customer growth, Teladoc Health is ready to do more for patients.
CEO Jason Gorevic said the telemedicine provider can play a big role in helping people manage high blood pressure, diabetes or other chronic conditions.
Plus he wants customers to think well beyond primary care when they consider telemedicine, which involves care delivered remotely, often with a live video connection through smartphones or tablets.
Last month, Teladoc finished a more than $18 billion deal to buy the technology company Livongo. Separately, the telemedicine provider said its total visits have more than doubled to 7.6 million so far this year, as COVID-19 has pushed more people to try remote care.
The 49-year-old Gorevic spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.
Q: You’ve talked about using the Livongo deal to create whole person virtual care. What will that look like?
A: You may be somebody with high blood pressure using a Livongo blood pressure cuff that’s uploading data. If you have one day of high blood pressure, we may send you a digital nudge that reminds you, ‘Hey, you should make sure that you’re watching yourself.’ If it’s high for a week, we may reach out with a coach. And if it’s high for a few weeks, now we have a doctor who’s available to connect and maybe change your medications and make sure you are taking (them) and that it’s the right dosage.
Q: Would the doctor call the patient?
A: No, we’re going to send you something that gives you the opportunity to request a visit. And if you’re not responding, we may reach out with a coach who offers to connect you.
Q: Before the pandemic, one of telemedicine’s biggest challenges was making patients remember to use the service when they need it. What’s the next big challenge?
A: Continuing to make them aware of the breadth of conditions that can be treated virtually. What they can get from virtual care is eye-opening to most people.
Q: Outside primary care, name a specialty primed for telemedicine growth.
A: We have a rapidly growing dermatology business. But it goes beyond that. We work with hospitals on a variety of cases ranging from oncology to cardiology to post-surgical follow up visits.
Q: What place does artificial intelligence have in virtual care? Will patients have basic care needs handled by a computer algorithm that asks questions and gathers data?
A: We think that AI can augment physicians to help them deliver better care. But we feel very strongly that data science can provide things like intelligent health nudges, looking at your blood sugar levels and reminding you based on whether you had breakfast, hey, maybe going out and taking the dog for a walk would be a good thing.

A Walk-On Opted Out. Then Came a $24,000 Bill.
The New York Times

Late Edition - Final

A committee found that the athletic department broke an N.C.A.A. rule by revoking Henry Bazakas's summer scholarship. His fight to get it back showed the cutthroat side of college football.
Henry Bazakas embodied everything the University of California wants in a football player. 
  A third-generation Cal student who grew up in Berkeley, Bazakas arrived on campus five years ago as a walk-on offensive lineman. Three times he earned an award for having the team's highest grade-point average. He and a teammate spearheaded a summer reading program at local elementary schools. He won another award, for his commitment to strength and conditioning while recovering from a torn knee ligament. And last season, after he finally earned an athletic scholarship, he started three games at left tackle.
  But none of that counted for much in June, when Bazakas called the Cal football coach, Justin Wilcox, to say that he was opting out of his final season because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
  The call was the beginning of an odyssey that illustrates the normally unseen, cutthroat side of the business of college football, with tensions that have been magnified for athletes by the determined push to play during the pandemic.
  Nine days later, Bazakas found his scholarship had been cut off, and he was then billed more than $24,000 halfway through his summer term because the athletic department had revoked the financial aid that it had already paid.
  The summer school aid was ultimately reinstated by a university appeals committee, which said the school had violated N.C.A.A. rules by abruptly pulling Bazakas's aid before giving him an opportunity for a hearing.
  Bazakas also asked for his scholarship back for the fall semester, but the appeals panel sided with the athletic department's decision to not renew it. While most of his teammates arrived at Cal with scholarships pledged for four years, walk-ons, like Bazakas, who eventually earn scholarships may not get them in subsequent years, and Cal had met an N.C.A.A. deadline in July not to renew his.
  ''It feels like the second I was done playing football, the program was done with me,'' said Bazakas, who waited nearly three months for his summer aid to be restored through appeal.
  Wilcox, the football coach, and Jay Larson, the senior associate athletic director who administers the football program and directed its arguments against Bazakas's appeal, declined interview requests about the case. Herb Benenson, an athletic department spokesman, said Bazakas knew that he had not been offered a scholarship for the 2020-21 academic year when he left the team.
  This is true, but only partly so. Bazakas had asked his coach several times over six months whether the scholarship would be renewed. He got no firm answer. Wilcox's decision came through an email from the financial aid office on June 25.
  Benenson said the athletic department, even though it argued against Bazakas, agreed with the university's decision to restore the player's summer aid. Benenson said the aid was mistakenly canceled because of a clerical error that did not come to light until an inquiry by The New York Times in mid-October, a month after the committee's ruling.
  Bazakas said neither Wilcox nor Larson, nor anyone else from Cal, had contacted him to acknowledge what Benenson characterized as ''an honest mistake.''
  'All the power is in the coach's hands -- you can't negotiate,' a former teammate said.
  As major college football has lurched through the pandemic in pursuit of billions in television revenue -- Cal had its first two scheduled games canceled, then lost Sunday to U.C.L.A. in a game arranged two days before kickoff -- not even mandated protections for players have been ironclad.
  In August, Washington State receiver Kassidy Woods, who opted out because he has the sickle cell trait, was allowed to keep his scholarship but removed from the team when Coach Nick Rolovich told Woods it would be ''an issue'' that he was aligned with a player rights' movement. Utah State Coach Gary Andersen, before he was fired after an 0-3 start, said there was a reason none of his players had opted out. ''It's not an option,'' he told reporters. ''If you opt out, you're not with us.''
  As players weigh their health risks, an unstated pressure urges them to continue competing to maintain their places in the pecking order for playing time. For those who arrived as walk-ons, a missed season heightens the uncertainty about whether a scholarship will be renewed.
  ''The way we use our voice, how we play or practice -- that's what determines if we keep our scholarship,'' said Gabe Siemieniec, a former walk-on kicker at Cal who transferred to Louisiana Tech before the season in part because he was not sure whether his scholarship would be renewed. ''It's kind of interesting. All the power is in the coach's hands -- you can't negotiate.''
  Programs at the top level of college football may offer up to 85 football scholarships each year with the remainder of a 120-player roster filled by non-scholarship players, or walk-ons.
  Walk-ons can be indispensable to even the best programs. In practices, they mimic opposing players to help the starters prepare for the next game. They often lift the team grade-point average and sometimes compensate for recruiting mistakes when they blossom into contributors. The patron saint of walk-ons is Hunter Renfrow, who caught a last-second touchdown to win the national championship for Clemson in 2017.
  For walk-ons, a scholarship is not just a financial reward.
  It is a stamp of legitimacy earned through sweat and sacrifice in the weight room and on the practice field, and through their play on Saturdays. Scholarships are often conferred in front of teammates in elaborate presentations, which the schools happily promote on social media.
  'You're supposed to make every decision for the team.'
  Bazakas recalled the immense pride he felt when Wilcox informed him that he would be on scholarship last year. Bazakas grew up sitting in the stands at Memorial Stadium rooting for Cal. His late grandfather, a Cal graduate, was a season-ticket holder. His father, a financial officer at a tech company, and his mother, an educator, graduated from Cal. His affinity runs so deep that he rejected his mother's suggestion that he apply to Cal's archrival, Stanford.
  Though Bazakas -- who started playing football in high school -- drew interest from Ivy League schools and Weber State, he jumped at an offer from Sonny Dykes, then the coach at Cal, to join the Golden Bears as a walk-on.
  ''That was a dream come true,'' Bazakas said.
  Bazakas quickly realized how far he was from playing in a game. But he got stronger and improved his technique. By his third season, he had worked his way up to the 70-player travel squad. The next season was cut short by a torn knee ligament.
  Last year, after being awarded a scholarship, Bazakas was thrust into the conference opener because of a teammate's injury and helped the team drive the length of the field for a late field goal to beat Washington. He started three games and also played in a victory over Stanford that ended Cal's eight-game losing streak in the rivalry.
  ''It was my proudest moment,'' Bazakas said.
  Bazakas had hoped for more highlights this season. He wanted to compete for a starting position. But he is grateful for the experiences he has had.
  ''I didn't want it to end the way it did, but in the scale of 2020, most things aren't going the way people wanted them to go,'' Bazakas said.
  Bazakas opted out at a moment of great uncertainty for college football players. Some schools were requiring athletes to sign liability waivers upon returning to campus for summer workouts, and it was weeks before conferences like the Big Ten, the Pac-12 and the Southeastern Conferences said they would honor scholarships for athletes who opted out. The N.C.A.A. did not make it a blanket policy until August. (The standard scholarship agreement says that athletes can have their aid canceled if they withdraw from a team.)
  ''You're supposed to make every decision for the team and that's what you want, but at some point, you're an individual,'' Bazakas said. ''You're not really allowed to advocate for yourself. You don't realize you can until you're out of the system.''
  Around the time Bazakas opted out, two close friends on the team -- offensive linemen Valentino Daltoso and Jake Curhan -- were at the center of a movement by Pac-12 players that pushed for more rights for players, including say on health protocols and protections for athletes who chose to sit out a season.
  Andrew Cooper, who ran cross-country at Washington State and Cal and has been an organizer in the athletes' rights movement, said Bazakas's case was one of many that were discussed as hundreds of players around the country had group conversations over the summer through videoconferencing. (Daltoso and Curhan did not respond to interview requests.)
  ''Ninety-nine percent of college athletes stay silent about the injustices they experience,'' Cooper said. ''We're told, 'Just be grateful.''' He added: ''When it comes down to it, no one is there to protect us, because athletic departments' financial interests do not align with athletes' interests.''
  The pandemic upended the best chance for walk-ons to earn their scholarships anew.
  Bazakas was among six walk-ons who received scholarships last season and were eligible to return in 2020. Wilcox made it clear that the aid was for one year and that subsequent years could be awarded if Cal had scholarships available.
  Two of those players were certain to have their scholarships renewed because of their strong play. Shortly after last season ended, the four others were called into Wilcox's office, one by one, and left with a similar impression: that their aid was very much uncertain for the next season. Some of their spots, for example, could be taken by transfers who would fill more urgent needs.
  The former walk-ons viewed spring practices as their best chance to prove to the coaches they deserved to have their scholarships renewed. But after four sessions, football was shut down because of the virus.
  ''Everything was up in the air,'' Siemieniec said.
  The three other players besides Bazakas entered the transfer portal to seek scholarship offers elsewhere. Two transferred, and one, tight end Collin Moore, had his scholarship renewed.
  Bazakas, though, was already deep into a master's program for information and data science, so leaving did not make sense.
  But by June, as teams planned for summer workouts, Bazakas began to question whether returning to campus was a good idea.
  Bazakas, who stands 6-foot-6, weighed 330 pounds at the time, putting him in a high-risk category if he contracted the virus. His parents are in their 50s, so they could be vulnerable, too. He worried about catching the virus while working out with his teammates, then bringing it home or to people in his neighborhood.
  ''The thought of going back scared me a lot,'' said Bazakas, who had repeated conversations with his teammates, his girlfriend and his family over several months.
  Finally, on June 16, the day before Cal announced players could return to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts, Bazakas called Wilcox.
  ''He was pretty understanding,'' Bazakas said. ''He said the world is crazy and everyone has to make a choice. He asked, 'Is there a chance I can talk you out of this or have you made up your mind?' I told him I had made up my mind. He said, 'OK, I respect that.' It wasn't a long conversation.''
  Bazakas said his scholarship was not discussed.
  'Man, I'm going to have to explain this to my parents.'
  When he called his coach, Bazakas did not know about the key date of July 1, when the N.C.A.A. requires schools to notify athletes of any roster reduction for the next academic year. The date was not mentioned in the financial aid agreement that Bazakas signed for 2019-20. Benenson, the athletic department spokesman, acknowledged that Bazakas had not been notified of Cal's deadline, but he said Wilcox had told the player not to expect a renewal.
  As for summer aid, each school makes its own decisions. This summer Cal tightened its financial belt. The athletic department, which was facing a $55 million deficit if there were no fall sports, largely restricted athletes to one summer class because of virus-related budget constraints, Benenson said.
  Bazakas appeared to be an exception. He received a text on May 18 from Joel Derechinsky, the team's academic coordinator, who asked if Bazakas needed to take all three classes he had registered for during the summer semester.
  Bazakas, who earned his bachelor's degree in business administration, replied that he wanted to leave his final two classes for the fall semester during the season. Derechinsky said that would be OK. (Derechinsky declined to be interviewed.)
  A month later, Bazakas received notice that he would no longer be on scholarship. One night as he considered whether to appeal, Bazakas checked his student account portal before he went to bed.
  He blinked.
  It carried two new charges on July 1: $23,506 for summer fees and $631 for the summer stipend. ''I was pretty shook,'' Bazakas said. ''I thought, 'Man, I'm going to have to explain this to my parents.'''
  As September approached, Bazakas filed the final paperwork in his appeal with the help of several family friends, including a lawyer.
  The athletic department countered Bazakas's plea for restoring his summer aid by offering part of it back. Larson, in a Sept. 3 letter to the appeals committee, wrote: ''Although we are not required to do so by NCAA rules, we have decided to provide summer aid to cover tuition and fees for one of Mr. Bazakas' courses.''
  The three-person committee sided with Bazakas. It said the athletic department failed to provide a hearing before his aid was revoked, which is required by N.C.A.A. rules.
  But Bob Jacobsen, an undergraduate dean who was on the committee, said Bazakas's summer aid was restored because Cal's policy does not allow aid to be revoked during a term. When asked why that was not written in the ruling, he said: ''This is not a Supreme Court decision where we have to cite it. If the document doesn't make sense as a public relations document, so be it.'' He added: ''We didn't expect anybody would be reading it.''
  Benenson said the athletic department learned more recently that its error occurred because Bazakas's courses were incorrectly classified as beginning in late July rather than in May.
  The case for a fall scholarship, Bazakas knew, was more difficult to make. He is spending $15,000 to take his last two classes and he will graduate in December.
  ''I understand the business of football -- if you don't need a lineman as bad as you need a receiver and you take it away,'' Bazakas said of the scholarship. ''But I never got an answer; I never heard a yes or no. When I talked to Coach Wilcox the last time, I said if I hadn't stepped away, would I have still gotten my aid? He didn't answer.''
  He added: ''That's the biggest what-if. If I hadn't opted out, what would have happened?''
  Bazakas -- who signed off on his appeal letters with ''Go Bears!'' -- said his experience had not soured him on Cal. He has followed the myriad twists his old teammates have endured -- in August the Pac-12 postponed football, only to later decide to play after all, albeit with a truncated schedule. Practices have been interrupted and schedules upended. He feels for his teammates.
  Last weekend Bazakas -- 50 pounds lighter, having shed some of his football girth -- sat in front of the TV and did what he had always done. He rooted for the Bears to win.

Analysis Shows Just 2% of Recent Films Have Explicit LGBT Representation

When LGBT people ask for more movies featuring LGBT people, they're invariably answered with a flat capitalist explanation: LGBT films don't make money. This is invariably presented as an insurmountable truth. But is it?
Independent scholar Ellie Lockhart wasn't so sure. Lockhart has a PhD in Communications studies but has recently been looking to move into a career in data science. She decided to put all of those skills together to see if she could determine whether, and which kinds, of LGBT films do well at the box office. Her ongoing project is to comb IMDB for box office data for LGBT films, compare them to films without LGBT representation, and see whether filmgoers will or will not go to these movies.
Lockhart's broader goal is to highlight the importance of LGBT representation not just in niche indie drama, but in big-budget franchise films, which are the movies that dominate pop culture attention and discourse. "I'm not a My Dinner with Andre film buff, I'm a No Country for Old Men film buff," Lockhart told me by email. "If I can prove the conventional gut wisdom wrong, maybe someone in the industry will see it and we'll finally get some lesbian Westerns or something. I just really want a lesbian Western."
The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.
Observer: What counts as LGBT representation in your study?Ellie Lockhart: This is a great question.  I cannot actually know every movie that meets the criteria. I haven't seen even a quarter of the films on this spreadsheet, largely because I don't have an interest in the vast majority of them.
So I used a multi-part strategy of painstakingly reviewing every entry for a feature film on IMDB that had any recorded US box office return and also including films which I knew by overwhelming reputation definitely met the criteria. For instance, The Old Guard is famously a streaming-only release, it has a budget but no known profits, which means that I can't include it in a lot of my figures but I can include it in counts of how often the criteria is actually met, whether or not that's financially profitable.
I found just under 100 movies to include from 2010-now. That's out of a dataset of 5,000. Even if we assumed I made coding errors and missed a couple of films, that's 2% of films including any major queer character/character who expresses any sort of queerness.
And then, to further check my lack of knowledge, I tried to include every film that made US box office returns and also had the IMDB keywords "gay," "lesbian," "homosexual," "transgender," "transsexual," "lgbt," or "queer," unless it appeared that "queer" was being used in its pre-contemporary sense. Obviously there were judgment calls.

Why is representation important, in your view? And why specifically does representation in bigger-budget films or franchises matter?Representation in general is important because as a culture we recognize stories define us, for good and for ill. People feel invisible when they don't see themselves in stories.
To get directly into why representation in big-budget films matters: it's partially because movies are a product people consume a limited amount of. And generally, it's going to cost the same amount for me to go see Avengers: Endgame (which does not meet the project criteria despite one of the directors playing a gay man in a single scene) as it's going to cost for me to go see, say, The Miseducation of Cameron Post, which is a critically acclaimed story about a queer girl forced to undergo conversion therapy. If I had unlimited time and unlimited focus, I would probably see both, but in practice, both I and most people will see Endgame. Even though I'm queer! Even though I really want to see queer depictions on screen! It's not enough to overcome the cultural pull of these kinds of big-budget stories.
Because of these tradeoffs, because queer people do want to be represented but that's not the only thing driving our entertainment decisions, since those are also financial and time management decisions, a lot of us end up following the crowd, or our own tastes, and choosing things that for many but not all of us are still more entertaining than a lot of low-budget entertainment. But we would rather see people like us in the entertainment we do consume.
You'd rather see lesbians assassinating people than suffering discrimination.I want to be clear on this: not all low-budget entertainment is unenjoyable. Some LGBT/queer people prefer the kinds of grounded entertainment that make up the bulk of actual titles meeting the project criteria. I remember as a kid my family got the Christian Science Monitor, and their film critic at the time in the late '90s absolutely adored every small gay film that came out, and hated anything science fiction, and I remember resenting him. I didn't fully know I was queer at that point in my childhood, but I certainly felt solidarity with queer people, but it annoyed the hell out of me that this guy was ripping into every film I liked and elevating these films I would find intensely dull regardless of who the main characters were.
The more personal answer, the thing actually driving putting hours into this project and choosing it as the focus of my data science efforts, is that I am a film buff and I am queer. I like Westerns, I like gangster films. The fact that queer film has so long skewed toward stories about mundane personal tragedy like Dallas Buyer's Club and before it Brokeback Mountain, but is so sparse in the kinds of things I grew up loving but wishing I saw more people like me in is frustrating. Infuriating even.
So, what did you find? Is there adequate representation of LGBT characters in large-budget films, in your view?No. There is not adequate representation of LGBT characters in large-budget films, in my view or by any sense of "adequate" I can conjure. The gay population in terms of people in the United States who outright identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual is 7% or 8%, but "significantly" more than that have had some kind of sexual involvement with someone who is the same sex according to the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior. The number of people who identify as transgender is really, really in flux and speaking as someone from that community I think any study numbers are way off.
But even if we take the generally accepted research numbers which I believe put trans people at somewhere under 1% of the population, but not that far under, we're underrepresented.
A film is included in the data set if, to the best of my knowledge 1) it returned any money in the United States box office OR was a major streaming release in the past several years that is classified by IMDB as a feature film; 2) it has a major character (protagonist, antagonist, deuteragonist, major supporting character) who is a) identified openly as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, asexual or something else clearly along these lines or, b) engages in what I would professionally qualify as unambiguous queer behaviors including but not entirely limited to kissing, sex, discussing same sex attraction, discussing a desire for gender transition, crossdressing for personal reasons (as opposed to "to infiltrate something" like various screwball and/or Shakespeare comedies).
What about films where characters are more or less obviously intended to be LGBT, but it's not stated outright?That brings me to something I consider really important to the development of this measure: the representation must be explicit. I excluded Captain Marvel, for instance, despite what I think is a very obvious intention by the filmmakers to imply that its protagonist and her best friend have a gay relationship. This is because I think the whole deniability thing is not something I want to reward. It's something I want to work past.
This also means I included some cases where the representation isn't great, but again, this data set is not about making judgments about the value of the work. Deadpool tops the list in most of the measures in terms of being a successful movie with a queer major character. In the case of the first Deadpool (the more profitable one), this is Deadpool himself, and the representation is mostly flirting with men that is treated humorously and is arguably kind of mocking of male bisexuality. The thing is, it's clear Deadpool is serious within the world of the story, he's definitely bisexual, it's confirmed in the text.
In any case, here's the raw truth: I found just under 100 movies to include from 2010-now. That's out of a dataset of 5,000. Even if we assumed I made coding errors and missed a couple of films, that's 2% of films including any major queer character/character who expresses any sort of queerness. Compared to at minimum 5%+0.5% of the population and probably much more.
We're very underrepresented, and we're even more underrepresented in big-budget cinema. I found about 36 films that qualified as not grounded drama films that met the criteria. Without drilling down at all into the content of these films, these are the films that fit the movies watched by the majority of people-the actual popular films that have LGBT people in them.
That's bad, and it certainly counteracts any claims about a "tipping point" or the "gay/trans agenda" being in everything.
People often claim LGBT characters are excluded because China would censor such films. Is that a good argument in your view?The"international box office" is frequently used by studio execs as an excuse for why not to include LGBT representation. The Chinese and Russian markets in particular get singled out, often in a racist way with respect to China.. I believe I can say that my analysis proves this wrong.
?
Data: LGBT Film Revenue, International & Domestic, Jan. 2010 - Aug. 2015, courtesy Ellie Lockhart
I've created a table showing domestic vs. international box office for important LGBT releases. Clearly, at least for big-budget movies with LGBT major characters, regardless of genre, the international box office is a huge help. These films are not being punished abroad, and in some cases (like Cloud Atlas) are actually doing better internationally.
Do LGBT films make money overall?So, the main question: do big-budget, genre (as opposed to grounded) LGBT films make money? Based on my analysis, many of them have! What's clear is that audiences, in the US and abroad, are willing to go see them. Most of those super-high-grossing movies also cost a lot of money to make. Deadpool 2 in particular barely broke even, even excluding its marketing budget, whereas the first Deadpool was extraordinarily successful on a dollar-for-dollar amount. But audiences will fill seats.
What it boils down to is this: franchises make money right now. Queer movies that are part of a franchise can put butts in seats, and also produce a favorable profit ratio. Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey did really well in theaters especially internationally, and features an explicitly bisexual lead and a very explicitly lesbian major heroine.
Outside of franchises, LGBT non-grounded films don't do quite as well. But thrillers or well-budgeted science fiction (Black Swan and The Shape of Water are exemplary here) returned extremely positive dollars-spent-dollars-earned figures, and seem to use the same dynamics non-queer films use (famous actress for the former, famous director/award nominee for the latter) to draw people to these slightly low-budget but still genre films.
It's true that in many of these genre titles, characters' queerness plays less of a role than it would in a comparable grounded drama. However, this is partly because of the nature of genre-if you're fighting hordes of enemies, your sexual orientation is part of your personality and matters to viewers, but it's not going to be quite as emphasized. In my opinion this is good, although I still frankly hope we can do better than Deadpool.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that .02% of recent films have explicit LGBT representation. The correct number, per Lockhart's analysis, is 2%.

A committee found that the athletic department broke an N.C.A.A. rule by revoking Henry Bazakas’s summer scholarship. His fight to get it back showed the cutthroat side of college football.
Henry Bazakas embodied everything the University of California wants in a football player.
A third-generation Cal student who grew up in Berkeley, Bazakas arrived on campus five years ago as a walk-on offensive lineman. Three times he earned an award for having the team’s highest grade-point average. He and a teammate spearheaded a summer reading program at local elementary schools. He won another award, for his commitment to strength and conditioning while recovering from a torn knee ligament. And last season, after he finally earned an athletic scholarship, he started three games at left tackle.
But none of that counted for much in June, when Bazakas called the Cal football coach, Justin Wilcox, to say that he was opting out of his final season because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The call was the beginning of an odyssey that illustrates the normally unseen, cutthroat side of the business of college football, with tensions that have been magnified for athletes by the determined push to play during the pandemic.
Nine days later, Bazakas found his scholarship had been cut off, and he was then billed more than $24,000 halfway through his summer term because the athletic department had revoked the financial aid that it had already paid.
The summer school aid was ultimately reinstated by a university appeals committee, which said the school had violated N.C.A.A. rules by abruptly pulling Bazakas’s aid before giving him an opportunity for a hearing.
Bazakas also asked for his scholarship back for the fall semester, but the appeals panel sided with the athletic department’s decision to not renew it. While most of his teammates arrived at Cal with scholarships pledged for four years, walk-ons, like Bazakas, who eventually earn scholarships may not get them in subsequent years, and Cal had met an N.C.A.A. deadline in July not to renew his.
“It feels like the second I was done playing football, the program was done with me,” said Bazakas, who waited nearly three months for his summer aid to be restored through appeal.
Wilcox, the football coach, and Jay Larson, the senior associate athletic director who administers the football program and directed its arguments against Bazakas’s appeal, declined interview requests about the case. Herb Benenson, an athletic department spokesman, said Bazakas knew that he had not been offered a scholarship for the 2020-21 academic year when he left the team.
This is true, but only partly so. Bazakas had asked his coach several times over six months whether the scholarship would be renewed. He got no firm answer. Wilcox’s decision came through an email from the financial aid office on June 25.
Benenson said the athletic department, even though it argued against Bazakas, agreed with the university’s decision to restore the player’s summer aid. Benenson said the aid was mistakenly canceled because of a clerical error that did not come to light until an inquiry by The New York Times in mid-October, a month after the committee’s ruling.
Bazakas said neither Wilcox nor Larson, nor anyone else from Cal, had contacted him to acknowledge what Benenson characterized as “an honest mistake.”
‘All the power is in the coach’s hands — you can’t negotiate,’ a former teammate said.
As major college football has lurched through the pandemic in pursuit of billions in television revenue — Cal had its first two scheduled games canceled, then lost Sunday to U.C.L.A. in a game arranged two days before kickoff — not even mandated protections for players have been ironclad.
In August, Washington State receiver Kassidy Woods, who opted out because he has the sickle cell trait, was allowed to keep his scholarship but removed from the team when Coach Nick Rolovich told Woods it would be “an issue” that he was aligned with a player rights’ movement. Utah State Coach Gary Andersen, before he was fired after an 0-3 start, said there was a reason none of his players had opted out. “It’s not an option,” he told reporters. “If you opt out, you’re not with us.”
As players weigh their health risks, an unstated pressure urges them to continue competing to maintain their places in the pecking order for playing time. For those who arrived as walk-ons, a missed season heightens the uncertainty about whether a scholarship will be renewed.
“The way we use our voice, how we play or practice — that’s what determines if we keep our scholarship,” said Gabe Siemieniec, a former walk-on kicker at Cal who transferred to Louisiana Tech before the season in part because he was not sure whether his scholarship would be renewed. “It’s kind of interesting. All the power is in the coach’s hands — you can’t negotiate.”
Programs at the top level of college football may offer up to 85 football scholarships each year with the remainder of a 120-player roster filled by non-scholarship players, or walk-ons.
Walk-ons can be indispensable to even the best programs. In practices, they mimic opposing players to help the starters prepare for the next game. They often lift the team grade-point average and sometimes compensate for recruiting mistakes when they blossom into contributors. The patron saint of walk-ons is Hunter Renfrow, who caught a last-second touchdown to win the national championship for Clemson in 2017.
For walk-ons, a scholarship is not just a financial reward.
It is a stamp of legitimacy earned through sweat and sacrifice in the weight room and on the practice field, and through their play on Saturdays. Scholarships are often conferred in front of teammates in elaborate presentations, which the schools happily promote on social media.
‘You’re supposed to make every decision for the team.’
Bazakas recalled the immense pride he felt when Wilcox informed him that he would be on scholarship last year. Bazakas grew up sitting in the stands at Memorial Stadium rooting for Cal. His late grandfather, a Cal graduate, was a season-ticket holder. His father, a financial officer at a tech company, and his mother, an educator, graduated from Cal. His affinity runs so deep that he rejected his mother’s suggestion that he apply to Cal’s archrival, Stanford.
Though Bazakas — who started playing football in high school — drew interest from Ivy League schools and Weber State, he jumped at an offer from Sonny Dykes, then the coach at Cal, to join the Golden Bears as a walk-on.
“That was a dream come true,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas quickly realized how far he was from playing in a game. But he got stronger and improved his technique. By his third season, he had worked his way up to the 70-player travel squad. The next season was cut short by a torn knee ligament.
Last year, after being awarded a scholarship, Bazakas was thrust into the conference opener because of a teammate’s injury and helped the team drive the length of the field for a late field goal to beat Washington. He started three games and also played in a victory over Stanford that ended Cal’s eight-game losing streak in the rivalry.
“It was my proudest moment,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas had hoped for more highlights this season. He wanted to compete for a starting position. But he is grateful for the experiences he has had.
“I didn’t want it to end the way it did, but in the scale of 2020, most things aren’t going the way people wanted them to go,” Bazakas said.
Bazakas opted out at a moment of great uncertainty for college football players. Some schools were requiring athletes to sign liability waivers upon returning to campus for summer workouts, and it was weeks before conferences like the Big Ten, the Pac-12 and the Southeastern Conferences said they would honor scholarships for athletes who opted out. The N.C.A.A. did not make it a blanket policy until August. (The standard scholarship agreement says that athletes can have their aid canceled if they withdraw from a team.)
“You’re supposed to make every decision for the team and that’s what you want, but at some point, you’re an individual,” Bazakas said. “You’re not really allowed to advocate for yourself. You don’t realize you can until you’re out of the system.”
Around the time Bazakas opted out, two close friends on the team — offensive linemen Valentino Daltoso and Jake Curhan — were at the center of a movement by Pac-12 players that pushed for more rights for players, including say on health protocols and protections for athletes who chose to sit out a season.
Andrew Cooper, who ran cross-country at Washington State and Cal and has been an organizer in the athletes’ rights movement, said Bazakas’s case was one of many that were discussed as hundreds of players around the country had group conversations over the summer through videoconferencing. (Daltoso and Curhan did not respond to interview requests.)
“Ninety-nine percent of college athletes stay silent about the injustices they experience,” Cooper said. “We’re told, ‘Just be grateful.’” He added: “When it comes down to it, no one is there to protect us, because athletic departments’ financial interests do not align with athletes’ interests.”
The pandemic upended the best chance for walk-ons to earn their scholarships anew.
Bazakas was among six walk-ons who received scholarships last season and were eligible to return in 2020. Wilcox made it clear that the aid was for one year and that subsequent years could be awarded if Cal had scholarships available.
Two of those players were certain to have their scholarships renewed because of their strong play. Shortly after last season ended, the four others were called into Wilcox’s office, one by one, and left with a similar impression: that their aid was very much uncertain for the next season. Some of their spots, for example, could be taken by transfers who would fill more urgent needs.
The former walk-ons viewed spring practices as their best chance to prove to the coaches they deserved to have their scholarships renewed. But after four sessions, football was shut down because of the virus.
“Everything was up in the air,” Siemieniec said.
The three other players besides Bazakas entered the transfer portal to seek scholarship offers elsewhere. Two transferred, and one, tight end Collin Moore, had his scholarship renewed.
Bazakas, though, was already deep into a master’s program for information and data science, so leaving did not make sense.
But by June, as teams planned for summer workouts, Bazakas began to question whether returning to campus was a good idea.
Bazakas, who stands 6-foot-6, weighed 330 pounds at the time, putting him in a high-risk category if he contracted the virus. His parents are in their 50s, so they could be vulnerable, too. He worried about catching the virus while working out with his teammates, then bringing it home or to people in his neighborhood.
“The thought of going back scared me a lot,” said Bazakas, who had repeated conversations with his teammates, his girlfriend and his family over several months.
Finally, on June 16, the day before Cal announced players could return to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts, Bazakas called Wilcox.
“He was pretty understanding,” Bazakas said. “He said the world is crazy and everyone has to make a choice. He asked, ‘Is there a chance I can talk you out of this or have you made up your mind?’ I told him I had made up my mind. He said, ‘OK, I respect that.’ It wasn’t a long conversation.”
Bazakas said his scholarship was not discussed.
‘Man, I’m going to have to explain this to my parents.’
When he called his coach, Bazakas did not know about the key date of July 1, when the N.C.A.A. requires schools to notify athletes of any roster reduction for the next academic year. The date was not mentioned in the financial aid agreement that Bazakas signed for 2019-20. Benenson, the athletic department spokesman, acknowledged that Bazakas had not been notified of Cal’s deadline, but he said Wilcox had told the player not to expect a renewal.
As for summer aid, each school makes its own decisions. This summer Cal tightened its financial belt. The athletic department, which was facing a $55 million deficit if there were no fall sports, largely restricted athletes to one summer class because of virus-related budget constraints, Benenson said.
Bazakas appeared to be an exception. He received a text on May 18 from Joel Derechinsky, the team’s academic coordinator, who asked if Bazakas needed to take all three classes he had registered for during the summer semester.
Bazakas, who earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration, replied that he wanted to leave his final two classes for the fall semester during the season. Derechinsky said that would be OK. (Derechinsky declined to be interviewed.)
A month later, Bazakas received notice that he would no longer be on scholarship. One night as he considered whether to appeal, Bazakas checked his student account portal before he went to bed.
He blinked.
It carried two new charges on July 1: $23,506 for summer fees and $631 for the summer stipend. “I was pretty shook,” Bazakas said. “I thought, ‘Man, I’m going to have to explain this to my parents.’”
As September approached, Bazakas filed the final paperwork in his appeal with the help of several family friends, including a lawyer.
The athletic department countered Bazakas’s plea for restoring his summer aid by offering part of it back. Larson, in a Sept. 3 letter to the appeals committee, wrote: “Although we are not required to do so by NCAA rules, we have decided to provide summer aid to cover tuition and fees for one of Mr. Bazakas’ courses.”
The three-person committee sided with Bazakas. It said the athletic department failed to provide a hearing before his aid was revoked, which is required by N.C.A.A. rules.
But Bob Jacobsen, an undergraduate dean who was on the committee, said Bazakas’s summer aid was restored because Cal’s policy does not allow aid to be revoked during a term. When asked why that was not written in the ruling, he said: “This is not a Supreme Court decision where we have to cite it. If the document doesn’t make sense as a public relations document, so be it.” He added: “We didn’t expect anybody would be reading it.”
Benenson said the athletic department learned more recently that its error occurred because Bazakas’s courses were incorrectly classified as beginning in late July rather than in May.
The case for a fall scholarship, Bazakas knew, was more difficult to make. He is spending $15,000 to take his last two classes and he will graduate in December.
“I understand the business of football — if you don’t need a lineman as bad as you need a receiver and you take it away,” Bazakas said of the scholarship. “But I never got an answer; I never heard a yes or no. When I talked to Coach Wilcox the last time, I said if I hadn’t stepped away, would I have still gotten my aid? He didn’t answer.”
He added: “That’s the biggest what-if. If I hadn’t opted out, what would have happened?”
Bazakas — who signed off on his appeal letters with “Go Bears!” — said his experience had not soured him on Cal. He has followed the myriad twists his old teammates have endured — in August the Pac-12 postponed football, only to later decide to play after all, albeit with a truncated schedule. Practices have been interrupted and schedules upended. He feels for his teammates.
Last weekend Bazakas — 50 pounds lighter, having shed some of his football girth — sat in front of the TV and did what he had always done. He rooted for the Bears to win.

College Park, Maryland-based Immuta, a data platform, has secured $8 million in Series A funding. Drive Capital led the round with participation from Greycroft Partners and Conversion Capital.
PRESS RELEASE
COLLEGE PARK, MD, Feb. 16, 2017 — Immuta, the unified data platform for the world’s most secure organizations, today announced an $8 million Series A round led by Drive Capital with participation from Greycroft Partners and Conversion Capital. The round brings the company’s total funding to $9.5 million to date.
The Immuta platform frees data science teams to work with highly-regulated data without being hamstrung by complex security regulations or information governance policies. The platform also gives information governance teams the confidence they need to expose sensitive data without breaching policies, which in turn gives data scientists the access they need to accelerate time-to-breakthrough.
“Data-driven companies are collecting data at an exponential rate in an attempt to better understand their customers and offer enhanced services; data is their biggest advantage, but it’s also their biggest risk. We de-risk the innovation process,” said Matthew Carroll, CEO of Immuta. “Immuta makes it possible to translate information governance policies into a unified data platform that manages access, controls, and collaboration, all in one place. In order to be effective, teams need a single, unified platform that streamlines their data workflows from end to end.”
Using Immuta, data scientists can quickly create immediately regulated and compliant data sandbox environments that combine disparate data sources from within and across organizations. Immuta supports every major structured and unstructured data source, on premise or in the cloud, including Amazon S3, SQL, NoSQL and Hadoop.
The Immuta platform virtualizes data from any data source, which protects the integrity of original data sets. This allows data owners to confidently expose data, and data scientists to experiment at will.
“Most data platforms today are simply point solutions aimed at niche industries or narrow pain points. Data science teams shouldn’t have to cobble together a platform just to do data integration, data governance, or to implement data access policies, and so forth. Their job is to do real data science, not to manage integrations and security across five different platforms,” said Steve Touw, CTO of Immuta. “The Immuta platform provides a governed and unified data foundation that is compatible with any tool a data scientist may want to use. Our customers trust us for our precise controls, and they depend on us to create secure, virtual data collaboration environments on demand.”
Immuta’s platform was purpose-built to simplify information governance, allowing for all policies—from access-based policies to purpose restrictions on data—to be quickly implemented by clicking a button, rather than writing new code. Information governance teams can set or modify policies through the platform, which seamlessly integrates policy into data science teams’ workflows and unlocks powerful methods of data collaboration and sharing.
“Immuta is solving one of the most acute problems that is stifling innovation at large, highly-regulated enterprises. They have the teams, and the technology, but data access and usage regulations are holding back innovation,” said Andy Jenks, Partner at Drive Capital. “We invested in Immuta because their team and technology are bar none the best in the business.”
Immuta’s customers include some of the largest global financial institutions, telecommunications companies and national security organizations in the world. To learn more about how Immuta can transform your business, please visit https://www.immuta.com/.

George Mahoney is an efficiency expert by trade and by nature. He's also among the analytics-minded coaches trying to bring data to one of the last holdouts in American sports -- high school football.
MIDDLETOWN, N.J. -- The Mater Dei Prep Seraphs faced fourth-and-6 from the Middletown South 40-yard line in a scoreless October game with about four minutes left in the first quarter. Their coach, Dino Mangiero, encountered a pretty standard decision: Go for it or punt? 
  His headset crackled.
  The voice on the other end belonged to a Columbia University graduate perched atop the school's tiny press box: George Mahoney, who doesn't have an official title on Mater Dei's staff or attend every practice, but who, in many ways, represents the early glimmers of what could be the future of high school football. A chemical engineer with 19 years of coaching experience and an affinity for innovative thinking, Mahoney serves as the analytics arm of Mater Dei's football operation.
  That very term, ''analytics'' -- which refers to the use of data analysis to inform decision-making -- has polarized big-money sports, pitting adherents against traditionalists in a zero-sum feud. A recent, prominent example of advanced metrics' sway over game decisions, when Tampa Bay Rays Manager Kevin Cash pulled his starting pitcher, Blake Snell, in Game 6 of the World Series last month, renewed the longstanding debate.
  The hidebound sport of football has been slower than most to accept the findings of the data army, with longtime coaches and executives generally distrustful of those who didn't play at a high level. But that is changing. In N.F.L. and college programs, some more than others, the growing influence of data science has reshaped everything from roster construction to asset management, elements of football dogma that might have seemed untouchable even five years ago.
  Still, one area remains off-limits to analytics: N.C.A.A. and pro teams are prohibited from using computers to guide in-game tactics and must depend on static reports to make strategy calls. A small number of high schools, though, like Mater Dei, can, and do, use decision-making aids in real time.
  On that afternoon last month, Mahoney, 42, on his tablet computer, consulted prescriptive analytical software called EdjVarsity, a new tool in his arsenal. It simulates hundreds of thousands of games to determine which in-game decisions improve a team's likelihood of winning. He had spent more than a decade trying to penetrate high school football with statistical analysis, finding the culture of community and tradition nearly impermeable until he massaged his pitch. Now, he is testing the risk tolerance of a middle-class Catholic school that has reached the state championship in New Jersey in each of the past four years.
  Mahoney entered basic details of that first-quarter drive -- score, time, field position, down and distance -- and out came a bar graph at the bottom of his screen totaling the win probability to be gained by going for it on fourth down in one-yard increments: fourth-and-1, fourth-and-2 and so on.
  He relayed his recommendation to the coach, as he always does, balancing his radical approach with the stakes for Mater Dei's season. ''You don't want to be in the position where you're this analytics guy,'' Mahoney said, ''and you're blowing it for these guys that are legitimately calling X's and O's and working with these kids all year.''
  Tripping Over the Truth
  As an agent of change, Mahoney acts deliberately. He knows Mangiero has a threshold for aggressiveness, so he doesn't push him beyond his comfort level. Instead, Mahoney relies on data to make other coaches, as he puts it, trip over the truth -- and Mangiero trusts him.
  ''He could be anything,'' Mangiero said, referring to a job title. ''The assistant head coach for analytics? Whatever George wants.''
  They have known each other for more than 25 years, since Mangiero, 61, a former N.F.L. defensive lineman who is in his fifth season at Mater Dei, coached him at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School on Staten Island. When he pondered in September adding someone to manage analytics, Mangiero didn't hesitate. He called Mahoney.
  For Mahoney, 5-foot-8 and a brawny 185 pounds, chasing efficiency is the through line connecting his personal and professional pursuits. It has been an obsession since childhood, when he would accompany his father, George, on calls to repair heating and air-conditioning units. Sitting in traffic, Mahoney would lament the time squandered that he could have been playing with friends.
  He walked onto the team at Columbia, where he obtained degrees in chemical engineering and mathematics, and then managed to manipulate his work schedule to allow him to coach.
  The first time he worked under Mangiero, in 2008, as the special-teams coach at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, Mahoney was frustrated. Not with his boss but with preparing for an opponent that, after it scored, would occasionally bypass kicking deep for an onside kick. The threat consumed him all week and then into the off-season, when he wondered whether data supported the risky play.
  Poring over statistics he had collected, Mahoney discovered that, yes, it made sense. But he also divined some unexpected special-teams trends. Namely, if 70 percent of punts were either fumbled or not caught at all, then what's the point in sending out a punt returner?
  ''I kept looking at the data and hoping I was wrong,'' he said.
  Mahoney considers this experience formative in his path to enlightenment. It fueled his interest in later projects, such as trying to quantify the correlation between offensive penalties and scoring drives. But his initial resistance also embodied the risk-averse culture so prevalent in football, where convention is doctrine. Especially in the high school realm, where a certain intimacy exists among town and team and sport.
  ''If a decision doesn't go well, you're going to hear it walking the school halls,'' said Adam Clack, the coach at Milton High School, north of Atlanta, one of the top Class 6A teams in Georgia. He is using EdjVarsity for a second consecutive season. ''You're going to hear it from the parents who have your phone number and aren't afraid to give you a call.''
  Mahoney was so curious about the challenge of securing community support in that climate that in 2016 he flew to Arkansas to visit another contrarian with a zeal for statistical analysis, Kevin Kelley, who felt like an outcast 17 years ago when he pioneered a no-punt philosophy that has propelled his Pulaski Academy team to eight state titles.
  ''People want to know why -- they really, really do -- and as long as you've got a great reason,'' Kelley said, ''they're willing to at least accept it.''
  When Mahoney was promoted to head coach at St. Peter's Boys High School, on Staten Island, in 2018, he reflected on that advice in his introductory speech to parents. Showing a video of two wildebeests standing backside to backside, Mahoney explained that if lions surrounded them, the wildebeests could swing around and protect each other. But if one strayed, the lions could eat them both.
  ''If you guys stick with us, we'll be OK,'' Mahoney said he told the parents. ''But the second one of you complains that we're not punting, or we onside kick, now you've exposed ourselves to the lions.''
  At St. Peter's, he shortened and streamlined practices to keep players and coaches fresh. By never punting, they could devote more time to offense and defense. He applied the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule: By focusing on the 20 percent of plays that the opposition ran 80 percent of the time, he eliminated unnecessary film study. Since players weren't running downfield to smash the wedge on kickoffs, their risk of injury was diminished -- not a single concussion, he said.
  To offset a disadvantage in talent, Mahoney felt St. Peter's had to play differently to compete, and indeed, games there doubled as a veritable advanced-stats carnival: The team used onside kicks, rarely deployed punt returners and went for it at counterintuitive times. Behaving in the extreme, he said, felt like the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who attacked Native Mexicans in 1519 with a small force and, to ensure his troops wouldn't retreat, ordered them to burn the boats they came on. Assistants who didn't agree with Mahoney quit.
  St. Peter's was 5-8 under Mahoney, but the record bothered members of the community less than the image the team projected. Fans booed when the team recovered onside kicks. In citing reasons for Mahoney's dismissal, the principal, Michael Cosentino, mentioned analytics but also said the team wasn't as physical or conditioned as he wanted.
  ''It didn't seem like we were putting our kids in the right position to win football games,'' Cosentino said. ''Certain things looked good on paper but don't really translate sometimes to the game. When you're dealing with individuals, they're not just numbers, our kids.''
  Scaling back, Mahoney said, would have felt like a betrayal of his values. But getting fired in the middle of the season still crushed his ego. In the aftermath, he wrote a 12-page treatise assessing his tenure. He attended the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference at M.I.T. and corresponded with Daniel Stern, an analyst with the Baltimore Ravens, one of the more analytics-savvy organizations in the N.F.L.
  As time passed, Mahoney grew ever more confident in his philosophy. It was his presentation that needed refining.
  ''Most people in the world, they've never won an argument with statistics,'' Mahoney said. ''To change conventional wisdom, you usually need a good story.''
  And when Mangiero called, in early September, Mahoney had one.
  The New Guy With the Tablet
  In his first few weeks at Mater Dei, Mahoney felt like an outsider. He worked with the specialists, but mainly, he observed, trying to negotiate his place. He wasn't sure how the other assistants perceived someone, even with his football background, coming in to oversee analytics, and he found it difficult, at first, to form relationships or read their expressions beneath their masks.
  On a staff that skews younger, Mahoney's arrival was met with enthusiasm but also some skepticism -- mostly, Mangiero said, from older coaches. But Mahoney had an ally in Mangiero, who said he had been interested in fourth-down aggressiveness since 2009, when New England went for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 28 late in the fourth quarter against Indianapolis -- and failed. Intrigued, Mangiero peppered his former player Brian Flores, then a Patriots assistant (and now the Miami Dolphins' coach), about Coach Bill Belichick's tactics.
  And when the Ravens excelled last season on fourth down, Mangiero went to a game in Baltimore -- his friend Joe Cullen is an assistant there -- and discussed their methodology afterward with Coach John Harbaugh.
  From Mahoney, Mangiero had heard about EdjVarsity, and asked him to use it to research whether Mater Dei should adjust its punting strategy. Breaking down the Seraphs' 27-25 loss in last season's state championship, he told Mangiero a story. On a video chat, Mahoney showed him a presentation detailing how certain decisions affected win probability.
  ''This whole thing is connected,'' Mahoney told him. ''All this stuff is chapters of a book. Let's put the chapters together and write the whole book.''
  Impressed, Mangiero, the next day, authorized investing $1,500 to buy an EdjVarsity yearly subscription. To acclimate himself, Mahoney would play an old edition of the Madden video game on simulation mode, pausing after each play to enter the updated details of the game.
  Every week, as Mater Dei has tripped over the truth, Mahoney's responsibilities have expanded. He now manages the clock and advises on 2-point conversion strategy. He communicates the fourth-down plan, based on the tablet readouts, early in the series to guide how Mangiero and the offensive coordinator, Taylor Groh, call plays.
  If on third-and-7, for example, Groh knows that Mater Dei will be going for it on fourth-and-3 or less, he might call a play that could net 4 or 5 yards instead of trying to gain all 7 at once.
  During the week, after synthesizing customized postgame reports, Mahoney prepares a slide show presentation for the coaching staff. One was so illuminating, Mangiero said, he showed it to the team as part of a larger message about precision.
  By demonstrating that turnovers cost the Seraphs 15.5 percent in win probability in their previous game, he reframed the importance of ball security in more urgent terms. When someone jumps offsides in practice, Mangiero reinforced his point by saying the offender cost them a touchdown.
  Mahoney marvels at how quickly Mater Dei has incorporated analytics, and to its advantage: The Seraphs (4-1) have won four consecutive games heading into Friday's season finale and are positioned to earn a playoff berth.
  He wants to continue bridging the gap between science and 150 years of football. He wants to educate coaches without demanding they conform. He wants to research and experiment, build templates and confidence. He also wants to be a head coach again, and to train an acolyte or two.
  Until then, he will appreciate giving Mater Dei an edge, as he did against Middletown South.
  As the final seconds ticked down in the Seraphs' 10-3 victory, Mahoney bumped fists with the assistants flanking him. He grabbed his Columbia laptop bag -- ''I need to bring the nerd side of me to football games'' -- and his headset. One by one, they headed down the stairs, toward the field, to their team, to celebrate together.

George Mahoney is an efficiency expert by trade and by nature. He’s also among the analytics-minded coaches trying to bring data to one of the last holdouts in American sports — high school football.
MIDDLETOWN, N.J. — The Mater Dei Prep Seraphs faced fourth-and-6 from the Middletown South 40-yard line in a scoreless October game with about four minutes left in the first quarter. Their coach, Dino Mangiero, encountered a pretty standard decision: Go for it or punt?

Poring over statistics he had collected, Mahoney discovered that, yes, it made sense. But he also divined some unexpected special-teams trends. Namely, if 70 percent of punts were either fumbled or not caught at all, then what’s the point in sending out a punt returner?
“I kept looking at the data and hoping I was wrong,” he said.
Mahoney considers this experience formative in his path to enlightenment. It fueled his interest in later projects, such as trying to quantify the correlation between offensive penalties and scoring drives. But his initial resistance also embodied the risk-averse culture so prevalent in football, where convention is doctrine. Especially in the high school realm, where a certain intimacy exists among town and team and sport.
“If a decision doesn’t go well, you’re going to hear it walking the school halls,” said Adam Clack, the coach at Milton High School, north of Atlanta, one of the top Class 6A teams in Georgia. He is using EdjVarsity for a second consecutive season. “You’re going to hear it from the parents who have your phone number and aren’t afraid to give you a call.”
Mahoney was so curious about the challenge of securing community support in that climate that in 2016 he flew to Arkansas to visit another contrarian with a zeal for statistical analysis, Kevin Kelley, who felt like an outcast 17 years ago when he pioneered a no-punt philosophy that has propelled his Pulaski Academy team to eight state titles.
“People want to know why — they really, really do — and as long as you’ve got a great reason,” Kelley said, “they’re willing to at least accept it.”
When Mahoney was promoted to head coach at St. Peter’s Boys High School, on Staten Island, in 2018, he reflected on that advice in his introductory speech to parents. Showing a video of two wildebeests standing backside to backside, Mahoney explained that if lions surrounded them, the wildebeests could swing around and protect each other. But if one strayed, the lions could eat them both.
“If you guys stick with us, we’ll be OK,” Mahoney said he told the parents. “But the second one of you complains that we’re not punting, or we onside kick, now you’ve exposed ourselves to the lions.”
At St. Peter’s, he shortened and streamlined practices to keep players and coaches fresh. By never punting, they could devote more time to offense and defense. He applied the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule: By focusing on the 20 percent of plays that the opposition ran 80 percent of the time, he eliminated unnecessary film study. Since players weren’t running downfield to smash the wedge on kickoffs, their risk of injury was diminished — not a single concussion, he said.
To offset a disadvantage in talent, Mahoney felt St. Peter’s had to play differently to compete, and indeed, games there doubled as a veritable advanced-stats carnival: The team used onside kicks, rarely deployed punt returners and went for it at counterintuitive times. Behaving in the extreme, he said, felt like the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who attacked Native Mexicans in 1519 with a small force and, to ensure his troops wouldn’t retreat, ordered them to burn the boats they came on. Assistants who didn’t agree with Mahoney quit.
St. Peter’s was 5-8 under Mahoney, but the record bothered members of the community less than the image the team projected. Fans booed when the team recovered onside kicks. In citing reasons for Mahoney’s dismissal, the principal, Michael Cosentino, mentioned analytics but also said the team wasn’t as physical or conditioned as he wanted.
“It didn’t seem like we were putting our kids in the right position to win football games,” Cosentino said. “Certain things looked good on paper but don’t really translate sometimes to the game. When you’re dealing with individuals, they’re not just numbers, our kids.”
Scaling back, Mahoney said, would have felt like a betrayal of his values. But getting fired in the middle of the season still crushed his ego. In the aftermath, he wrote a 12-page treatise assessing his tenure. He attended the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference at M.I.T. and corresponded with Daniel Stern, an analyst with the Baltimore Ravens, one of the more analytics-savvy organizations in the N.F.L.
As time passed, Mahoney grew ever more confident in his philosophy. It was his presentation that needed refining.
“Most people in the world, they’ve never won an argument with statistics,” Mahoney said. “To change conventional wisdom, you usually need a good story.”
And when Mangiero called, in early September, Mahoney had one.
The New Guy With the Tablet
In his first few weeks at Mater Dei, Mahoney felt like an outsider. He worked with the specialists, but mainly, he observed, trying to negotiate his place. He wasn’t sure how the other assistants perceived someone, even with his football background, coming in to oversee analytics, and he found it difficult, at first, to form relationships or read their expressions beneath their masks.
On a staff that skews younger, Mahoney’s arrival was met with enthusiasm but also some skepticism — mostly, Mangiero said, from older coaches. But Mahoney had an ally in Mangiero, who said he had been interested in fourth-down aggressiveness since 2009, when New England went for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 28 late in the fourth quarter against Indianapolis — and failed. Intrigued, Mangiero peppered his former player Brian Flores, then a Patriots assistant (and now the Miami Dolphins’ coach), about Coach Bill Belichick’s tactics.
And when the Ravens excelled last season on fourth down, Mangiero went to a game in Baltimore — his friend Joe Cullen is an assistant there — and discussed their methodology afterward with Coach John Harbaugh.
From Mahoney, Mangiero had heard about EdjVarsity, and asked him to use it to research whether Mater Dei should adjust its punting strategy. Breaking down the Seraphs’ 27-25 loss in last season’s state championship, he told Mangiero a story. On a video chat, Mahoney showed him a presentation detailing how certain decisions affected win probability.
“This whole thing is connected,” Mahoney told him. “All this stuff is chapters of a book. Let’s put the chapters together and write the whole book.”
Impressed, Mangiero, the next day, authorized investing $1,500 to buy an EdjVarsity yearly subscription. To acclimate himself, Mahoney would play an old edition of the Madden video game on simulation mode, pausing after each play to enter the updated details of the game.
Every week, as Mater Dei has tripped over the truth, Mahoney’s responsibilities have expanded. He now manages the clock and advises on 2-point conversion strategy. He communicates the fourth-down plan, based on the tablet readouts, early in the series to guide how Mangiero and the offensive coordinator, Taylor Groh, call plays.
If on third-and-7, for example, Groh knows that Mater Dei will be going for it on fourth-and-3 or less, he might call a play that could net 4 or 5 yards instead of trying to gain all 7 at once.
During the week, after synthesizing customized postgame reports, Mahoney prepares a slide show presentation for the coaching staff. One was so illuminating, Mangiero said, he showed it to the team as part of a larger message about precision.
By demonstrating that turnovers cost the Seraphs 15.5 percent in win probability in their previous game, he reframed the importance of ball security in more urgent terms. When someone jumps offsides in practice, Mangiero reinforced his point by saying the offender cost them a touchdown.
Mahoney marvels at how quickly Mater Dei has incorporated analytics, and to its advantage: The Seraphs (4-1) have won four consecutive games heading into Friday’s season finale and are positioned to earn a playoff berth.
He wants to continue bridging the gap between science and 150 years of football. He wants to educate coaches without demanding they conform. He wants to research and experiment, build templates and confidence. He also wants to be a head coach again, and to train an acolyte or two.
Until then, he will appreciate giving Mater Dei an edge, as he did against Middletown South.
As the final seconds ticked down in the Seraphs’ 10-3 victory, Mahoney bumped fists with the assistants flanking him. He grabbed his Columbia laptop bag — “I need to bring the nerd side of me to football games” — and his headset. One by one, they headed down the stairs, toward the field, to their team, to celebrate together.

Portland, Oregon-based Vesta, a cybersecurity firm, has secured an investment from EDBI. No financial terms were disclosed.

PRESS RELEASE

August 3, 2020 - LAKE OSWEGO, Ore. - Vesta, a fintech pioneer in fraud protection and fully guaranteed payment technologies, has secured a strategic investment from EDBI, a global Asian-based investor. This investment, along with a strategic alignment with EDBI, will accelerate the company’s momentum and efforts to expand its fraud and approval enhancement platform across Asia Pacific (APAC). Vesta will have its regional headquarters in Singapore.

Hailing from Portland, Oregon, Vesta recently raised $125 million in new growth capital from private equity firm Goldfinch Partners. The funding provides the company with the resources to invest in growth and continue the global deployment of its fraud protection and e-commerce payment solutions.

“We are excited to accelerate the execution of our strategy in APAC. The opportunity to partner with EDBI is exciting and this new investment really sets us up to go fast. Singapore is a natural spot from which to centralize our APAC operations. The combination of a dynamic business environment, first-class infrastructure and talent, and its central location for accessibility to the entire region, coupled with EDBI as our partner, made Singapore an easy choice,” said Ron Hynes, CEO of Vesta.

Vesta enables companies to grow their online businesses by eliminating the fear of fraud. This allows customers to focus on what really matters for success, growing revenue. Vesta’s real-time decisioning platform – built on data science and machine learning with more than 25 years of intelligence – analyses customers’ online payment transactions to assess the risk of fraud and is backed by Vesta’s zero-risk, zero-liability payment guarantee, meaning customers never have to worry about the risk of fraud again. Removing the fear of fraud also decreases the likelihood of incorrectly declining good customer transactions and increases revenue. Vesta provides its service directly to partners in the telecommunications and e-commerce industries around the globe and also allows merchants to seamlessly integrate through commerce and payments platforms including Plaid, Shopify, and Verifone.

Fraud in the Asia Pacific
As growth in e-commerce transactions continues to accelerate across the region, fraud poses a challenge for organizations. According to the 2019 Experian Identity and Fraud Report[1], online fraud losses increased by 50% of surveyed businesses in APAC in the past year. Despite the growth of fraud – including account takeovers, transaction fraud, e-skimming and brute force attacks driven by professional crime rings – most organizations are still reliant on reactive strategies, using manual safeguards and low-tech models with high operating costs to manage these events, resulting in lost revenue and poor consumer experiences. Vesta helps companies to eliminate the fear and risk of fraud, altogether, allowing them to focus on growth.

“APAC is a region that has an immediate need for our firm’s solutions and it was a natural choice to make Singapore our regional headquarters. We are thrilled to partner with EDBI and be part of their portfolio family, and we are looking forward to working together to build and grow partnerships across the region,” said Shabab Muhaddes, Vesta’s GM for Asia Pacific.

About Vesta Corporation
Vesta is a leader in guaranteed fraud protection and e-commerce payment solutions that help online merchants, major telcos, payment processors and acquirers optimize revenue by eliminating the fear of fraud.

How Democracy Can Survive Big Data

Only a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions -- the election of its leaders -- would have seemed even more absurd.
Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it. 
  ''Data drives all that we do.'' That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.
  The heart of Cambridge Analytica's power is an enormous information warehouse -- as many as 5,000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans, according to recent reporting, a fact the company proudly confirms on its website. Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms, and by an expanding data-mining culture operating without restrictions.
  That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.
  An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also establish cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash.
  Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?
  Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook's user data. ''We also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it,'' he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.
  This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.
  Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg's fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.
  The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.
  The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America's fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth's psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.
  The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests -- I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments -- would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.
  Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica's Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.
  For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.
  Now in print: ''Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments,'' and ''The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,'' with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.

On Campus, Computer Science Departments Find a Blind Spot: Ethics

PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The medical profession has an ethic: First, do no harm.
Silicon Valley has an ethos: Build it first and ask for forgiveness later. 
  Now, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley's top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.
  This semester, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are jointly offering a new course on the ethics and regulation of artificial intelligence. The University of Texas at Austin just introduced a course titled ''Ethical Foundations of Computer Science'' -- with the idea of eventually requiring it for all computer science majors.
  And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.
  The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations -- like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars -- before those products go on sale.
  ''It's about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two, three, five, 10 years, the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with,'' said Mehran Sahami, a popular computer science professor at Stanford who is helping to develop the course. He is renowned on campus for bringing Mark Zuckerberg to class.
  ''Technology is not neutral,'' said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. ''The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.''
  The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects -- fake news on Facebook, fake followers on Twitter, lewd children's videos on YouTube -- of the industry's build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.
  ''We need to at least teach people that there's a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,'' said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. ''You can patch the software, but you can't patch a person if you, you know, damage someone's reputation.''
  Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.
  But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.
  ''Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,'' said Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab.
  One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning -- computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.
  ''As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,'' he said. (Mr. Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)
  Last fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges -- such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions like hiring or college admissions.
  ''It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,'' said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.
  In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies.
  ''A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,'' Professor Levy said. ''If data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.''
  The Harvard-M.I.T. course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder.
  The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data -- like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records -- to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?
  Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled ''Ethics, Public Policy and Computer Science.''
  The expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami's popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.
  The new ethics course covers topics like artificial intelligence and autonomous machines; privacy and civil rights; and platforms like Facebook. Rob Reich, a Stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course, said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers, product designers and policymakers. Students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code.
  ''Stanford absolutely has a responsibility to play a leadership role in integrating these perspectives, but so does Carnegie Mellon and Caltech and Berkeley and M.I.T.,'' said Jeremy Weinstein, a Stanford political science professor and co-developer of the ethics course. ''The set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train.''

Tech’s Ethical ‘Dark Side’: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It

PALO ALTO, Calif. — The medical profession has an ethic: First, do no harm.
Silicon Valley has an ethos: Build it first and ask for forgiveness later.
Now, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley’s top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.
This semester, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are jointly offering a new course on the ethics and regulation of artificial intelligence. The University of Texas at Austin just introduced a course titled “           Ethical Foundations of Computer Science” — with the idea of eventually requiring it for all computer science majors.
And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.
The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations — like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars — before those products go on sale.
“It’s about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two, three, five, 10 years, the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with,” said Mehran Sahami, a popular computer science professor at Stanford who is helping to develop the course. He is renowned on campus for            bringing Mark Zuckerberg to class.
“Technology is not neutral,” said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. “The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.”
The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects — fake news on Facebook,            fake followers on Twitter, lewd            children’s videos on YouTube — of the industry’s build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.
“We need to at least teach people that there’s a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,” said Laura Norén, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. “You can patch the software, but you can’t patch a person if you, you know, damage someone’s reputation.”
Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited           by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.
But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.
“Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,” said Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab.
One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning — computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.
“As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,” he said. (Mr. Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)
Last fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges — such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions like hiring or college admissions.
“It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,” said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.
In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies.
“A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,” Professor Levy said. “If data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.”
The Harvard-M.I.T. course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder.
The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data — like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records — to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?

For Trump, 'the Polls That Matter' Are Those That Point to Victory

President Trump's blinkered view of 2020 polling has created something of an alternate universe, even as his campaign struggles to find the voters he needs in the data it has.
When President Trump talks about polling, his focus is very much on survey-takers that he thinks are good for him. Polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- virtually all national polls -- are simply ''fake news.'' 
  The president's blinkered view has created something of an alternate universe, one not governed by polling averages or independent analysis but by declarative statements that, at times, feel as if they are coming out of nowhere.
  This month, Mr. Trump proclaimed on Twitter that he was ''winning BIG in all of the polls that matter.''
  Such polls seem to boil down to Rasmussen Reports, which consistently -- and in isolation -- has a rosier picture for the president nationally than other surveys do, and the Trafalgar Group, which has had better numbers for Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
  His choose-your-own-adventure approach to polling that has shown little understanding of data science, and his pronouncements have come as his advisers are trying to take in serious polling and data analysis to make sense of what the electorate voting in 2020 will look like.
  It has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump's public commentary since the first time he ran for president that he treats polling as rigged against him if it isn't favorable for him. Despite his campaign spending $10 million over the past two years on some of the most sophisticated data available, the president prefers to use what he sees on the news. And he treats voter support as a mystical, rather than a mathematical, proposition.
  Some of Mr. Trump's advisers believe there is a wellspring of ''shy'' or ''hidden'' Trump voters -- predominantly whites without college educations in rural areas -- who are either not candid with pollsters about their choice for president, or aren't responsive to pollsters at all.
  This week, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, gave his own view of how polling works to Fox News, trumpeting ''big data modeling'' over old-fashioned phone calling.
  ''I speak to all my state directors,'' said Mr. Kushner, who has positioned himself as the leader of the Trump campaign, though he is not in fact the campaign manager, adding, ''I do believe that polling with phones to people is an obsolete method, especially in the era of cancel culture. You've got a lot of snake oil salesmen who have kind of been in the business for a long time and they do this.''
  He concluded, ''They were all completely wrong last time, and they didn't make any modifications going forward.''
  That is not quite true: Though many state polls proved very wrong in 2016, the national polls that projected Hillary Clinton narrowly winning the most votes were close to the mark, and many polling outfits did make modifications, weighting, for instance, for educational backgrounds.
  Complaining that polls are ''skewed'' against Republicans has been a vocal pastime of Republican candidates for several election cycles, reaching a high pitch in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party's presidential nominee.
  Officials continue to claim in 2020 that the public polling is wrong because they're ''skewed'' against Mr. Trump, overweighting Democrats in the samples.
  Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said that incumbents usually ended up ''on Election Day with a ballot share that is within a point or two of their October job approval score.'' In Mr. Trump's case, his average approval score is 45 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.
  The Trump campaign has spent years and presumably millions of dollars engaging white voters without college educations who are eligible to vote but did not vote in 2016. There are almost 1.5 million such potential voters in Michigan and more than two million in Pennsylvania.
  But at the end of the day, much of the ''hidden'' vote stays hidden -- that's why voter turnout isn't ever 100 percent, Mr. Blizzard said.
  Beyond the polling, the fundamentals shaping the electorate, like the economy and the record-breaking coronavirus surge, are ''increasingly ominous'' for Mr. Trump, said Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist.
  ''Ironically, the polls may be the best thing the Trump campaign has going for it at this point,'' he said.
  While Mr. Trump makes polling a punchline, both his campaign and the Republican National Committee rely on data to decide where to allocate resources. One of the murkiest issues is modeling for which voters will turn out during a pandemic and an economic downturn.
  And the Trump campaign has kept polling data one of its deepest secrets since leaked internal polling early in the campaign prompted a shake-up of the polling team.
  The campaign has been using various analyses, not all of which overlap. Traditional polling has been handled by the Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, who were hired when Brad Parscale, the previous campaign manager, was running the effort; Mr. Parscale's deputy campaign manager, the former White House political director Bill Stepien, took over in July.
  There has also been analysis by the former Cambridge Analytica official Matt Oczkowski, who is referred to as ''Oz.'' Mr. Kushner has held up Mr. Oczkowski's analyses, which cut against public polling and suggest votes will break Mr. Trump's way in the final days of the campaign, people who have heard the comments said.
  The amount of polling from Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. McLaughlin has dwindled in recent weeks. Instead, Mr. Stepien quietly hired another pollster, Bill Skelly, who helped create the Republican National Committee's complex modeling for voter turnout scenarios and who is conducting data analysis for the camp, and Brock McCleary, who has worked with clients who include congressional Republicans. Mr. McCleary's estimates of Mr. Trump's poll standing are less ''negative'' than some other Trump pollsters, according to people close to the campaign.
  Mr. Parscale, who had worked fairly closely with the R.N.C., had envisioned continuous robust television ad spending through the year. Since he stepped aside, the Trump campaign, which has far less money than advisers had once anticipated, has slashed its television spending. Exactly what data has driven the allocation of the campaign's remaining ad spending is unclear.
  Two Republicans said that from the time Mr. Parscale was demoted until a meeting a few weeks ago, the campaign had not reviewed R.N.C. data that tracks specific voters and likelihood they'll support the president. That meeting was convened by Mr. Kushner to get the campaign and the R.N.C. to work together more effectively. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, denied that was the case, and a spokesman for the R.N.C. said the organizations were working effectively together.
  The R.N.C. turnout models vary by state, but in some scenarios, it shows Mr. Trump performing worse than he does in the campaign's own polls, two people briefed on the numbers said.
  Nonetheless, that meeting led to a final $26 million television allocation led by the R.N.C.
  Whether the weeks without a unified front between the campaign and the party committee will have been a significant factor in the outcome of the race remains to be seen. And whether the ''hidden'' voters the Trump team has sought matters more than a few percentage points is also unclear.

Alessandra Biaggi, Nathaniel Koloc
Alessandra Rose Biaggi and Nathaniel Smith Koloc met in January 2015 when both were New York City New Leaders Council fellows. They gathered in Manhattan to learn about progressive politics, entrepreneurship and campaigns one weekend a month for five months.
“In the first session we didn’t talk to each other,” Ms. Biaggi said, “but without saying anything there was an energy.”
Mr. Koloc could also sense her intensity and seriousness. “We were two of the people in the group who were asking speakers the hardest questions,’’ he said.
At the February meeting, after Mr. Koloc was offered the role of the director of talent acquisition and development on Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign-in-waiting team, he asked Ms. Biaggi about her job and her next move.
“I’m going to work in the White House,’’ said Ms. Biaggi without skipping a beat.
Mr. Koloc, taken by her moxie, asked if she would work on a campaign, which she quickly took to mean a local one.
“How about a presidential race,’’ he countered, and his calm audacity stunned her.
“Who is this person,’’ she recalled thinking.
At the March meeting Mr. Koloc, more sure-footed in his job, asked Ms. Biaggi to send her résumé to the campaign, and by May she was on its vetting team.
“Everything was urgent in the moment,’’ said Ms. Biaggi, who vetted anything that touched Mrs. Clinton, including staff, volunteers, individuals, locations and social media influencers. “It was total chaos and I loved it.”
After a few weeks of sitting six desks from each other, they began grabbing coffee together or walking along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade during breaks.
In June, as they left a Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett benefit at the Plaza, Ms. Biaggi’s mother called to tell her that her grandfather, Mario Biaggi, died, and was touched when Mr. Koloc then showed up at her grandfather’s wake.
“It was a meaningful and hard moment,” she said.

Crystal Sanders, Uwemedimo Umoumoh
The couple were made aware of each other in March 2017. An uncle of Mr. Umoumoh, who also happened to be a colleague of Ms. Sanders at Penn State, told her she would be an excellent match for his nephew, who was teaching chemistry and geography at a middle school in Uyo.
“The person he described to me seemed like a really nice guy, but he happened to live on another continent,” Ms. Sanders said. “Besides, I wasn’t interested in getting set up.”
She passed along her email address and had all but forgotten about Mr. Umoumoh until the following month, when she received a message from him.
“One of the first things he tells me is that he has no interest in a relationship, and that he was pretty much calling as a favor to his uncle, because when an elder in Nigeria asks you to do something, you just do it,” Ms. Sanders said.
They proceeded to chat for a while and emailed each other periodically. He eventually asked for her phone number and began texting her, and by early October 2017, they were chatting on the phone.
“It had really turned into a pretty nice friendship,” Mr. Umoumoh said. “We even started giving each other dating advice.”
Ms. Sanders began to see Mr. Umoumoh in a different light “when he began talking about his personal life and the failed relationships he was a part of,” she said. “He was the first guy I ever knew who did not place all of the blame on the women he had broken up with, choosing instead to put a lot of the blame squarely on his shoulders, and I admired the fact that he was honest and mature enough to admit that.”
A world away, Mr. Umoumoh’s admiration and feelings for Ms. Sanders were also blossoming.
“Despite the distance between us, we had so many things in common, especially the fact that we have a very strong Christian faith,” he said. “Every conversation was better than the one before, and the one thing I really enjoyed about talking to her was that she let me be myself.”

To Trump, ‘the Polls That Matter’ Point to Victory. The Rest Are ‘Fake.’

President Trump’s blinkered view of 2020 polling has created something of an alternate universe, even as his campaign struggles to find the voters he needs in the data it has.
When President Trump talks about polling, his focus is very much on survey-takers that he thinks are good for him. Polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. — virtually all national polls — are simply “fake news.”
The president’s blinkered view has created something of an alternate universe, one not governed by polling averages or independent analysis but by declarative statements that, at times, feel as if they are coming out of nowhere.
This month, Mr. Trump proclaimed on Twitter that he was “winning BIG in all of the polls that matter.”
Such polls seem to boil down to Rasmussen Reports, which consistently — and in isolation — has a rosier picture for the president nationally than other surveys do, and the Trafalgar Group, which has had better numbers for Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
His choose-your-own-adventure approach to polling that has shown little understanding of data science, and his pronouncements have come as his advisers are trying to take in serious polling and data analysis to make sense of what the electorate voting in 2020 will look like.
It has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump’s public commentary since the first time he ran for president that he treats polling as rigged against him if it isn’t favorable for him. Despite his campaign spending $10 million over the past two years on some of the most sophisticated data available, the president prefers to use what he sees on the news. And he treats voter support as a mystical, rather than a mathematical, proposition.
Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers believe there is a wellspring of “shy” or “hidden” Trump voters — predominantly whites without college educations in rural areas — who are either not candid with pollsters about their choice for president, or aren’t responsive to pollsters at all.
This week, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, gave his own view of how polling works to Fox News, trumpeting “big data modeling” over old-fashioned phone calling.
“I speak to all my state directors,” said Mr. Kushner, who has positioned himself as the leader of the Trump campaign, though he is not in fact the campaign manager, adding, “I do believe that polling with phones to people is an obsolete method, especially in the era of cancel culture. You’ve got a lot of snake oil salesmen who have kind of been in the business for a long time and they do this.”
He concluded, “They were all completely wrong last time, and they didn’t make any modifications going forward.”
That is not quite true: Though many state polls proved very wrong in 2016, the national polls that projected Hillary Clinton narrowly winning the most votes were close to the mark, and many polling outfits did make modifications, weighting, for instance, for educational backgrounds.
Complaining that polls are “skewed” against Republicans has been a vocal pastime of Republican candidates for several election cycles, reaching a high pitch in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party’s presidential nominee.
Officials continue to claim in 2020 that the public polling is wrong because they’re “skewed” against Mr. Trump, overweighting Democrats in the samples.
Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said that incumbents usually ended up “on Election Day with a ballot share that is within a point or two of their October job approval score.” In Mr. Trump’s case, his average approval score is 45 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.
The Trump campaign has spent years and presumably millions of dollars engaging white voters without college educations who are eligible to vote but did not vote in 2016. There are almost 1.5 million such potential voters in Michigan and more than two million in Pennsylvania.
But at the end of the day, much of the “hidden” vote stays hidden — that’s why voter turnout isn’t ever 100 percent, Mr. Blizzard said.
Beyond the polling, the fundamentals shaping the electorate, like the economy and the record-breaking coronavirus surge, are “increasingly ominous” for Mr. Trump, said Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist.
“Ironically, the polls may be the best thing the Trump campaign has going for it at this point,” he said.
While Mr. Trump makes polling a punchline, both his campaign and the Republican National Committee rely on data to decide where to allocate resources. One of the murkiest issues is modeling which voters will turn out during a pandemic and an economic downturn.
And the Trump campaign has kept polling data secret since leaked internal polling early in the campaign prompted a shake-up of the polling team.
The campaign has been using various analyses, not all of which overlap. Traditional polling has been handled by the Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, who were hired when Brad Parscale, the previous campaign manager, was running the effort; Mr. Parscale’s deputy campaign manager, the former White House political director Bill Stepien, took over in July.
There has also been analysis by the former Cambridge Analytica official Matt Oczkowski, who is referred to as “Oz.” Mr. Kushner has held up Mr. Oczkowski’s analyses, which cut against public polling and suggest votes will break Mr. Trump’s way in the final days of the campaign, people who have heard the comments said.
The amount of polling from Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. McLaughlin has dwindled in recent weeks. Instead, Mr. Stepien quietly hired another pollster, Bill Skelly, who helped create the Republican National Committee’s complex modeling for voter turnout scenarios and who is conducting data analysis for the camp, and Brock McCleary, who has worked with clients who include congressional Republicans. Mr. McCleary’s estimates of Mr. Trump’s poll standing are less “negative” than some other Trump pollsters, according to people close to the campaign.
Mr. Parscale, who had worked fairly closely with the R.N.C., had envisioned continuous robust television ad spending through the year. Since he stepped aside, the Trump campaign, which has far less money than advisers had once anticipated, has slashed its television spending. Exactly what data has driven the allocation of the campaign’s remaining ad spending is unclear.
Two Republicans said that from the time Mr. Parscale was demoted until a meeting a few weeks ago, the campaign had not reviewed R.N.C. data that tracks specific voters and likelihood they’ll support the president. That meeting was convened by Mr. Kushner to get the campaign and the R.N.C. to work together more effectively. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, denied that was the case, and a spokesman for the R.N.C. said the organizations were working effectively together.
The R.N.C. turnout models vary by state, but in some scenarios, it shows Mr. Trump performing worse than he does in the campaign’s own polls, two people briefed on the numbers said.
Nonetheless, that meeting led to a final $26 million television allocation led by the R.N.C.
Whether the weeks without a unified front between the campaign and the party committee will have been a significant factor in the outcome of the race remains to be seen. And whether the “hidden” voters the Trump team has sought matters more than a few percentage points is also unclear.

New Enterprise Associates led a $33 million Series B funding round in machine learning company DataRobot Inc. Accomplice, Intel Capital, IA Ventures, Recruit Strategic Partners and New York Life also participated in the round. Boston-based DataRobot has raised more than $57 million to date.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, Feb. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Machine learning automation pioneer DataRobot, Inc. announced today that it has closed $33 million in Series B financing, bringing the total investment in the company to more than $57 million. New Enterprise Associates (NEA) led the round, which also included Accomplice, Intel Capital, IA Ventures, Recruit Strategic Partners, and New York Life.
With customers and offices already established in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the United States, DataRobot is funded for aggressive expansion in global sales, marketing, business development, engineering, R&D, and strategic initiatives at all locations.
“We applied our first investment towards building a solid platform rather than marketing and publicity,” said Jeremy Achin, the Company’s CEO and Co-Founder. “We hired the world’s top data scientists and software engineers to create the industry’s most usable machine learning platform. Then, we focused on ensuring our early customers’ success.  This additional investment will allow us to bring our solution to many more customers around the world, and to further democratize data science across all industries.”
DataRobot shrinks the data science project backlog that is growing in many companies due to the serious shortage of machine learning skills.  The company captures the knowledge, experience, and best practices of the world’s top data scientists and transfers them through practical education and software automation to users of all skills levels.  DataRobot enables data scientists, statisticians, business analysts, and software developers to build and implement predictive applications using open source and custom machine learning algorithms, in industries including financial services, healthcare, life science, marketing services, and others.
“We’ve seen the evolution of transformative advanced analytics technology within our portfolio, from Tableau turning data analysts into business analysts, to DataRobot turning business analysts into data scientists,” said Harry Weller, General Partner at NEA. “The DataRobot platform empowers users to easily build fast and accurate predictive models, something that previously required time-intensive labor by expert data scientists.”
“Unlike most startups in this industry, DataRobot was founded by – and is run by – applied data scientists, not serial entrepreneurs looking to catch a wave in a hot market,” said Chris Lynch, Partner at Accomplice (formerly Atlas Venture).  “DataRobot’s rapid ascent is a strong signal that machine learning has advanced from an elite technology to a powerful and differentiating business application.”
“Intel Capital is focused on building technology ecosystems by investing in transformative entrepreneurs and game-changing technologies,” said Ron Kasabian, Vice President of Intel Corp’s Data Center Group and General Manager of Big Data Solutions. “DataRobot’s team of experts and machine learning platform is a great example of a company that is driving innovation in data science.”

Where the STEM Jobs Are and Aren't

The national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that's understandable. A country's proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.
The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term -- first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation -- is used as a descriptive identifier. ''She's a STEM,'' usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes. 
  Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren't. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.
  What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the ''T'' (specifically, computing).
  Earlier this year, Glassdoor, a jobs listing website, ranked the median base salary of workers in their first five years of employment by undergraduate major. Computer science topped the list ($70,000), followed by electrical engineering ($68,438). Biochemistry ($46,406) and biotechnology ($48,442) were among the lowest paying majors in the study, which also confirmed that women are generally underrepresented in STEM majors.
  ''There is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,'' said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor's chief economist.
  At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand. The top 10 last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.
  In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.
  A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.
  ''When it gets generalized to all of STEM, it's misleading,'' said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. ''We're misleading a lot of young people.''
  Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study -- only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey. Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.
  If physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.
  Insight Data Science Fellows Program, which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft. Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky. So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.
  Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
  Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn't making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.
  Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn't get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.
  ''It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,'' he recalled.
  Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight Data Science Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product -- his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video -- and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. ''Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,'' he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)
  Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.
  The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is ''extremely rich'' and ''it moves so much faster than my previous world.'' He makes a ''pretty good six-figure salary,'' about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.
  About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.
  Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center's doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.
  Data science is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like data science and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.
  That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley's ''Foundations of Data Science'' course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.
  The choice of the term ''division'' rather than ''institute,'' explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. ''We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,'' he said. ''This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.''

Who wants a job, but doesn’t have one? How has the composition of the unemployed in the United States changed during the pandemic?
This graph shows the composition of the unemployed in the United States from January – September 2020. The graph appeared elsewhere on NYTimes.com.
By Friday morning, Nov. 6, we will reveal the graph’s free online link, additional background and questions, shout-outs for great student headlines, and Stat Nuggets.
After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:
• What do you notice?
• What do you wonder?
• What impact does this have on you and your community?
• What’s going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.
The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order.
2. Next, join the conversation online by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box. (Teachers of students younger than 13 are welcome to post their students’ responses.)
3. Below the response box, there is an option for students to click on “Email me when my comment is published.” This sends the link to their response which they can share with their teacher.
4. After you have posted, read what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting a comment. Use the “Reply” button to address that student directly.
On Wednesday, Nov. 4, teachers from our collaborator, the American Statistical Association, will facilitate this discussion from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time.
5. By Friday morning, Nov. 6, we will reveal more information about the graph, including a free link to the article that included this graph, at the bottom of this post. We encourage you to post additional comments based on the article, possibly using statistical terms defined in the Stat Nuggets.

 Go to the American Statistical Association K-12 website, which includes teacher statistics resources, professional development opportunities, and more.
Students 13 and older in the United States and the United Kingdom, and 16 and older elsewhere, are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.
The Reveal
“Covid-19 tore a hole through the U.S. economy,” says The New York Times’ October 3, 2020 article “Job Gains Lose Momentum As Promising Recovery Stalls.” As of October, the national economy had 11 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. The total number of unemployed workers both in and out of the workforce, which is calculated from different sources than the jobs data, went from 12 million in January 2020, then exploded to 32 million in April 2020 (167 percent increase) before subsiding to 19 million by September 2020. (This was an 58 percent increase over January 2020). It is not surprising that in an October 5-11, 2020 online survey conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times, 30 percent of respondents said that they were financially worse off.
This “vase” graph appeared in the October 12, 2020 New York Times article “The Shape(s) of a Crisis.” It shows the composition of the “total unemployed”, those who have been temporarily laid off, have been out of work for less than four weeks, or are in the “other” category. The “other” category of unemployed workers includes those who had temporary jobs or who chose to leave their jobs because of transportation issues, needing to care for their family, susceptibility to the virus, and other issues. The graph also shows the number of workers who are not in the labor force (including those who have been unemployed for more than four weeks), but want a job.
How many workers have returned to work? Based on the shapes of the subgroups in the vase graph, which workers may have shifted between from one subgroup to another?
Here are some of the student headlines that capture the stories of these graphs: “Unemployment: The Silent Killer” by Sadie of Dallas; “As Covid-19 Spreads, So Does Unemployment” by Katie of Andover, Massachusetts; “Increasing Pandemic, Lowering Paychecks” by Aboubakary and “A Job Pandemic” by Victor, both of the Bronx, New York; and “Is Corona Firing People?” by Zamir and “Unemployment: A Covid Conundrum” by Aidan, both of New York.
You may want to think critically about these questions:
• The number of temporarily laid off workers has diminished since April. Based on evidence in the graph, what employment status could these people now have? Some options may be within the graph; others may be outside the graph.
• Some workers are unemployed because of family or transportation issues. What are some of the specifics of these issues? Where would these people be shown in the graph in April? In August?
• Workers have been affected differently based on the business sector in which they worked. After studying the graphs in the October 3, 2020 New York Times article “Jobs Gains Lose Momentum as Promising Recovery Stalls,” answer these questions:
• Which business sectors have seen an increase in jobs?
• Which business sectors are seeing the greatest adverse effect due to the pandemic and have reduced their workforce?
• Overall, what has been the net effect (increases in the number of employees minus the decreases in the number of employees)? What surprises do you see in job gains and losses?
• This graph could be called a vase graph because of its shape. Why do you think the graphic designers used a vase graph rather than the typical time series graph with stacked areas for each of the subgroups with Jan. 2020 – Sept. 2020 on the x-axis and number of unemployed on the y-axis?
Because of the Veteran’s Day holiday on Wednesday, November 11, there will be no graph release for next week. The next release will be by Friday, Nov. 13 with live-moderation on Wednesday, Nov. 18. The topic: Thanksgiving favorite foods. So you don’t miss any releases, you can receive the 2020-2021 “What’s Going On In This Graph?” schedule by subscribing here to the Learning Network Friday newsletter. Keep noticing and wondering.

STACKED AREA GRAPH
Stacked area graphs show trends over time and compare the relative sizes of subgroups of a whole. The comparison may be in terms of absolute numbers or percentages.
In the pandemic unemployment graph, the time period is January 2020 to September 2020. The whole is the total number of unemployed plus people who are not in the labor force but want a job. The category of unemployed is divided into the subgroups of temporarily laid off, permanently laid off, and other. The other category includes workers who chose to leave their jobs or who had temporary jobs. What is usual about this graph is that time is on the vertical axis and the number of workers is on the horizontal axis. The variable, number of workers, is represented by the total distance from both sides of the center vertical line.
________
The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney. Ms. Hessney wrote the “reveal” and Stat Nuggets with Erica Chauvet, mathematics professor at Waynesburg University in Pennsylvania, and moderates online with Dashiell Young-Saver, a high school statistics teacher in San Antonio and data science graduate student at Harvard. He is the founder of Skew The Script, which provides relevant math and statistics curriculum to teachers.
