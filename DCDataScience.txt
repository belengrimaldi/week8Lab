Morning Take: Senate GOP releases relief package
Congressional Quarterly Health
July 28, 2020 Tuesday

 Copyright 2020 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Length: 2097 words
Body




TOPLINES
1. Senate GOP releases relief bill -- The bill includes billions more for providers and drugmakers. 
2. Meeting between drugmakers and White House pushed off -- The future of an executive order to peg Medicare prices to the prices paid overseas is unclear. 
3. 2020 candidates talk vaccines -- Trump promised a vaccine "very soon." Biden called for transparency from the FDA.
MORNING TAKE
1. Senate GOP releases relief bill
Senate Republicans released their proposals for the next coronavirus relief package Monday evening. The plan was spread out in a series of bills. 
- CQ News (07/27) -- Senate GOP unveils virus relief package; formal talks begin
- CQ News (07/27) -- Health proposals from Senate GOP draw praise and concern (view health supplemental appropriations - S 4320, draft bill text and summary; education and health - S 4322,  bill summary; tax and health - S 4318, draft bill text and summary; liability - S 4317, draft bill text; trust fund rescue - S 4323,  draft bill text; personal protective equipment supply chain - S 4324, draft bill text and description; and PPP extension - S 4321, draft bill text and summary)
The provider relief fund would receive another $25 billion as part of one measure. The bill also would delay repayment of Medicare Accelerated and Advance loans until Jan. 1, 2021. The Federation of American Hospitals President Chip Kahn said that "does not sufficiently ease the burden." The legislation would authorize $16 billion for contract tracing and surveillance; $9 billion of funding approved under an earlier relief bill (PL 116-139) remains unspent. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would receive $6 billion to develop a vaccine distribution plan. Another $20 billion would go to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for vaccine and therapeutic development. The bill would appropriate another $3.4 billion to state, local and tribal public health needs and influenza vaccination. The National Institutes of Health, which is aiding with vaccine and therapeutic clinical trials, would receive $15.5 billion. 
The bill's most contentious feature with Democrats is a liability safe harbor for businesses from customers and employees who get sick. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has described the provision as a "red line" for Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly expressed opposition. 
Among the businesses protected, the bill offers a safe harbor for "health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and nurses as well as nursing homes and other care facilities" from "liability claims arising out of the provision of care for coronavirus or services provided as a result of coronavirus," according to bill language circulated by the office of Sen. John Cornyn.
Some hospitals and health care systems, including Tenet Healthcare in Detroit, Montefiore Health Center in New York City, and Landmark Hospital in Athens, Ga., have been sued over conditions that nurses say led them to becoming exposed to COVID-19. 
The bill would appropriate another $2 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile. The measure also would require states to establish stockpiles for medical emergencies and authorize federal funding for their upkeep. Criticized for the shortages in the Strategic National Stockpile that have plagued the response to the pandemic, President Donald Trump has argued that states are responsible for maintaining PPE supplies. The bill seeks to improve the national stockpile by increasing is reserves through partnerships with manufacturers and distributors and would require HHS to publish guidance on how states and tribes should request supplies. 
The Senate bill also would create a refundable payroll tax credit amounting to 50 percent of expenses for testing supplies, PPE, cleaning supplies, thermometers and also workplace adjustments with the primary purpose of protecting employees from the spread of COVID-19. The tax credit would be capped at $500 to 1,000 per worker, depending on the number of employees.   
The bill also seeks to tamp down on the outbreaks that have devastated nursing homes by requiring nursing homes to report if their outbreaks have worsened in the past week and by creating federal "strike teams" to assist with testing and infection control. But the bill would allocate no extra funding for these aims and calls on HHS to dip into money from the CARES Act (PL 116-136).
2. No movement evident on plan to tie drug prices to overseas costs 
Drugmakers said they won't meet today with the White House, after all. President Donald Trump said Friday that the White House planned to meet with pharmaceutical executives on the administration's proposal to peg drug prices in Medicare Part B to the prices other rich countries pay. It's fiercely opposed by the drug industry. Trump set a deadline of Aug. 24 for the executives to hammer out an alternative. 
The drugmakers balked. There is no meeting scheduled, three industry sources said Monday. "Right now, our industry's sole focus is figuring out a way to beat COVID-19," said Nicole Longo, director of public affairs at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, in an emailed statement. "The president's plan to import policies from socialized health care systems abroad is disrupting our work and diverting our focus away from those life-saving efforts."
Patient advocate groups that support the measure were skeptical of the announcement from the start. "The administration's decision to bring drug prices in Medicare Part B more in line with what other wealthy nations pay would be a positive step if implemented," Ben Wakana, executive director of Patients For Affordable Drugs Now, said in a statement on Friday. 
The executive order to bring down Medicare Part B prices was one of four executive orders announced Friday, but the language for that executive order has not yet been released. Three others, including a proposal favored by the drug industry to eliminate pharmaceutical benefit managers' rebates in Medicare Part D, were issued Friday, but it's not clear if and when they will take effect. 
3. Attention turns to vaccines as election nears
Trump promised a vaccine "very soon" as he toured a vaccine production plant in Morrisville, N.C., Monday. Trump conducted a press conference at Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies, coinciding with a new $256 million investment by Operation Warp Speed into expanded manufacturing at a separate Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies facility. "America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time," Trump said (view CQ transcript). 
Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies is a subcontractor of Novavax, a vaccine maker that announced a $1.6 billion investment from Operation Warp Speed earlier this month. The company is expected to release preliminary results on the safety and efficacy of its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine candidate in July. 
Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health and Moderna announced the start of Phase 3 clinical trials on its vaccine. Answers to questions about the vaccine's efficacy could come by November.
- CQ News (07/27) -- NIH: COVID-19 vaccine trial results may be ready by November
Former Vice President Joe Biden called on the Food and Drug Administration to be transparent in its approval or emergency authorization of any vaccine in a statement Monday. "As we enter the height of election season, President Trump should assure us all that the White House will respect the independent authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to decide, free from political pressure, if the vaccine is safe and effective," Biden said. 
Biden called for the FDA to convene a meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a coalition of outside experts that conducts its meetings in public and grants an opportunity for public input. Biden also called on career agency scientists with the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to publish its recommendations on whether a vaccine should be authorized and approved.
Some experts are concerned that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn will authorize a vaccine even if his agency's scientists make a behind-the-scenes recommendation against it. That would be "unprecedented," former CBER Director Jesse Goodman said in an interview with CQ Roll Call earlier this month.

Tyler, the Creator; Jaden Smith; and GoldLink
Music
Merriweather Post Pavilion
September 21
In Igor, the latest album from Tyler, the Creator, we     follow the psychedelic-rap-and-harmony-laden arc of an emotional breakup     from the frustrating start to a compromising, I-wish-you-the-best end. In     this outdoor show, he'll highlight his new collaboration with Jaden     Smith-yes, Will and Jada's son-and share the stage with local rapper     GoldLink. $29.50 to $69.50; merriweathermusic.com.
Maggie Rogers
Music
The Anthem
October 7-8
An Eastern Shore native, indie/country crooner Maggie Rogers     got famous three years ago when a video of Pharell reacting to one of her     songs went viral. Although her 2019 debut album, Heard It in a Past Life, received mixed reviews, she's a powerhouse performer:     passionately compelling, belting ballads with her whole body-sometimes     even barefoot. $45 to $75; theanthemdc.com.
29Rooms
Etc.
DC Armory
October 18-27
Started by the team behind Refinery29 in 2015, this     made-for-Insta­gram pop-up installation features 29 immersive, interactive     rooms designed by national and local artists.

"Women Artists of the Dutch Golden Age"
Museums

Swap the well-known "Girl With a Pearl Earring" for works such as     the gorgeously creepy insect paintings of Maria Sibylla Merian, whose     illustrated books contributed to research in bot­any and zoology. Each     artist was a trailblazer in her own right during the 17th and 18th     centuries, whether in still lifes, joyous portraits, or detailed florals.     $10; nmwa.org.
Sleater-Kinney

St. Vincent-produced     their latest album, The Center Won't Hold, but just before its     release this summer, drummer Janet Weiss left the group abruptly. While     Weiss's replacement hadn't been announced by press time, the show is still     on-and it will be interesting to see how the group handles losing their     longtime member. $37.50 to $62.50; theanthemdc.com.

"The idea was to hold people accountable,     be confrontational, let it be messy, let it be angry," said Harris earlier     this year in an interview with Branden Jacob-Jenkins. In this     participatory and provocative work, Harris asks-and answers, in part-how a     community can heal. $29; woollymammoth.net.

Commander Says Special Forces Established "Experimentation" Force To Address Digital Battlefield
The White House Bulletin

Length: 230 words

The increasingly data-driven, networked, miniaturized, and automated world where goods, information, and people move across the globe "at a furious pace significantly impacts virtually every aspect" of US Special Operations Forces, Gen. Raymond Thomas, head of US Special Operations Command, said in testimony this morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee. "We understand this impact and embrace and harness the opportunities offered by technology." Data science, artificial intelligence, automated systems, and cryptography "are no longer restricted or isolated products available to select powers. They are commodities accessible to all," he told lawmakers. "Social media and publicly available information presents us with a world of far fewer shadows for concealment and yet opportunities for understanding heretofore unseen indicators of adversarial intent or action. For this reason, to achieve our mission we cannot relent in our pursuit of capabilities that will sustain and increase our advantage along the entire spectrum of conflict." As a result, USSOCOM is establishing an "experimentation force" that "will ensure that our pursuits remain solidly in support of our operational success on the battlefield," Thomas added. "Embracing these technologies will allow our workforce to consume and process data in ways that exceed basic human cognitive capabilities."

The White House Bulletin

President: Elizabeth Warren. On NBC Nightly News, Lester Holt reported Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) "is apologizing now that her past claims of Native-American ancestry have once again come back to haunt her." NBC's Peter Alexander added that Warren's bid "for the White House is again facing rough terrain. 'The Washington Post' revealing [a] 1986 registration card for the Texas bar, showing for the first time in her own handwriting Warren identified herself as 'American Indian.'" On ABC World News Tonight, David Muir reported that Warren's "apology comes just days before she's officially set to kick off her presidential campaign." 
Warren was shown saying, "It is about an apology from the heart. And apology for not being more sensitive to tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty." On the CBS Evening News, Nancy Cordes reported that Warren, who "launched a presidential exploratory committee in December," has "been dogged by her decision decades ago to list herself as Native American at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. And she drew fire from Cherokee tribal leaders last year when she tried to put the issue behind her with a highly publicized DNA test." The AP reports, "By providing fresh evidence that she had personally identified her race" as American Indian on the Texas bar registration card, "the document resurrected the flap just as" Warren is attempting "to gain momentum for her 2020 presidential bid, which she's expected to formally announce on Saturday. Warren didn't rule out the possibility of other documents in which she identified as a Native American." The Boston Herald reports that the latest development in the Warren saga "had reporters peppering her with questions on Capitol Hill while Cherokees slammed her and even fellow Democrats questioned her viability." The Washington Post reports on "Wednesday, after the bar registration card was published by The Washington Post, Warren faced new doubts about her viability in the presidential race, as activists and strategists evaluated how much damage the issue might do - especially given Democrats' focus on finding a candidate who can defeat President Trump - and what she might do to move past it." Reuters reports some Democrats "worried the controversy could cause her campaign to falter even before she formally announces on Saturday. 'They mishandled it from the minute that she was presented with evidence that she isn't Native American,' said Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist in Boston." ? The Washington Times reports the RNC on Wednesday "asked the Texas state Bar to take disciplinary action against...Warren" in the wake of the Washington Post article revealing "that she claimed Native American heritage on her bar card." The RNC argued "that puts her in violation of the bar's requirement to show good moral character. 'It has now been thirty-three (33) years since she made this representation to the Texas Bar and has never made an attempt to correct her registration card." In her Boston Globe column, Joan Vennochi that Warren's "mishandling of" the Indian-heritage controversy "is now part of her political DNA and apologies won't change it. ... In what way has Warren put this mess behind her? She hasn't. And that's her dilemma, in a party that, above all, wants to defeat Trump."
Joe Biden.
CNN reported 62% of "Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say former Vice President Joe Biden (D) should make a run for president, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, and half of all Americans say they would be at least somewhat likely to back him should he run for the White House." CNN said, "Support for a bid from Biden is higher among Democratic voters this year (62%) than it was in 2015," when "only about half of Democratic voters said they wanted Biden to run (53% in August, 47% in October)." CNN added that Biden "is one of two candidates in the poll who generate stronger support among those Democrats who consider the ability to beat [President] Trump 'extremely important' in choosing their party's nominee. About half of those who prioritize winning say they are very likely to support Biden." Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) "is the other candidate to garner greater support among these voters [38%] who prioritize beating Trump." The San Francisco Chronicle reports Biden and Harris "generate the most excitement among Democratic voters in California when it comes to the field of 2020 presidential candidates, according to a" Quinnipiac University poll of 452 California Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, taken Jan. 30-Feb. 4. In the poll, 60% of respondents said they "'would be excited' if Biden" won the Democratic presidential nomination, 58% said the same about Harris, 44% about Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), 40% about ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX), and 21% about Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). ? Politico reports Biden is wooing congressional Democrats as he nears a decision about a White House bid. Politico says, "In recent weeks," Biden "has spoken with former congressional colleagues about how he sees his chances in 2020, his timing for entering the race, and what it would take for him to compete in a crowded Democratic primary."
Howard Schultz.
Bloomberg reports ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz (I) "is unlikely to land in the White House if he makes an independent bid for the presidency, but he would probably pull enough votes away from a Democratic candidate to strengthen Donald Trump's prospects for re-election," according to a nationwide poll of 1,290 US voters "conducted by Optimus, a data-science firm that's studying the effects of independent candidates on the 2020 race." Schultz draws "7.7 percent of voters overall, but pulls twice as much support from Democrats (11.6 percent) as Republicans (5.6 percent)." In a hypothetical one-on-one matchup, former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leads Trump 50%-43%. However, Biden holds just a four-point lead "when Schultz is included." Trump leads Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) 45%-43%, but that edge increases to four points "with Schultz as an option. Trump also led 3-way races against" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX). ? In Politico Magazine, Derek Robertson writes that during "his nearly three-decade career with Starbucks, Schultz used memos, training materials and frequent communication with his 'partners,' as he referred to even the lowliest employee, to ensure that his personality permeated the company. ... 'Starbucks puts the 'cult' in 'culture," said Lisa Essett, a former barista from the Flint, Michigan area. 'It reminded me of Heaven's Gate, or L. Ron Hubbard with Scientology or something.'" ? CNN reported it "will host a town hall next week in Houston with...Schultz as he mulls a presidential bid in 2020. Schultz, who said last month he is considering a run as a 'centrist independent,' will take questions from Texas voters on Tuesday, February 12, in this live event moderated by CNN's Poppy Harlow."
Beto O'Rourke.
Under the headline "O'Rourke Was Once Adrift In New York City. Now He's Searching Again," the New York Times reports how ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX), as a 23-year-old in New York City in the mid-90s, "had fallen into the deepest depression he can remember," working "for an uncle's tech business because it was a job," and spending "nights alone listening to his cassettes because it passed the time." Today, says the Times, "long after what friends describe as a quarter-life crisis, Mr. O'Rourke has arrived at a midlife crossroads of enormous consequence, with revealing parallels to his time in New York." In an accompanying piece, the New York Times reports, "In a series of posts on Medium, Mr. O'Rourke has detailed his somewhat aimless recent travels - seeing sights, thinking thoughts, dining with strangers - in a confessional style uncommon among presidential contenders."
John Hickenlooper.
WMUR-TV Manchester, NH reports ex-Gov. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) "appears to be moving closer to a run for president, and he's making a visit to" New Hampshire. He "will be in the state on Feb. 13 and 14."
Tim Ryan.
Fox News reported Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), "who raised his national profile several years ago with an unsuccessful leadership challenge against Nancy Pelosi, could soon join the growing field of Democratic presidential candidates." Speaking on Tuesday with Fox News, the "moderate" Ryan said, "I'm still looking at it. I don't have a time frame just yet."
Mitch Landrieu.
Politico reported that during a Wednesday appearance on CNN, ex-New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu (D-LA) said "that he does not think he will seek his party's 2020 presidential nomination, citing the already packed field of 'great candidates.' 'I don't think so,'" Landrieu "responded when asked whether he would mount a 2020 bid. 'A lot of people have asked me that. I never say never, but at this point in time I don't think I'm going to do it.'"
Governors.
Coverage of what multiple outlets call the "chaos" at the top ranks of the Virginia state government is dominated by two late-breaking stories. On Wednesday, state Attorney General Mark Herring (D-VA), who would become governor if both Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D-VA) resign, admitted to wearing blackface to a college party. Just two hours later, the woman accusing Fairfax of sexual assault released a detailed statement on the alleged 2004 incident. The Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch reports Fairfax's accuser "broke her silence Wednesday, releasing a statement through her lawyers that laid out her claim against Fairfax in graphic detail and accused him of trying to paint her as a liar." In the statement, Vanessa Tyson said, "Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation. Given his false assertions, I'm compelled to make clear what happened." The Los Angeles Times reports Tyson said in her statement that she "did not speak about the encounter with Fairfax for years and suppressed the memories in order to focus on her academic career." ABC News reported Tyson contacted Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) about her allegations over a year ago. Scott said in a statement, "Allegations of sexual assault need to be taken seriously. I have known Professor Tyson for approximately a decade and she is a friend. She deserves the opportunity to have her story heard." The Washington Post reports that "in response to Tyson's statement, Fairfax denied the allegation of sexual assault and Tyson's description of what happened." Jeff Glor opened the CBS Evening News by saying, "First it was the governor. Then the lieutenant governor. Now the state attorney general - the top three leaders in the state, all Democrats, all facing deep controversy. ... [Herring] admitted today that he once wore blackface at a college party." CBS' Ed O'Keefe added that Herring had called on Northam "to resign over a racist photo, including a man in blackface, that was discovered on his medical school yearbook page." Lester Holt said at the start of NBC Nightly News, "The stain of scandal is spreading across Virginia politics tonight as that state's attorney general admits that he too had once appeared wearing blackface. Mark Herring becoming the third high-ranking Virginia Democrat to become embroiled in controversy since last Friday." ... The AP reports state Sen. Ralph Alvarado (R-KY), the 2019 running mate of Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY), "was one of a dozen doctors federal authorities said received improper gifts from a home health agency." Various media "outlets report the US attorney's office argued in a lawsuit that Nurses Registry and Home Health broke the law by giving gifts to Alvarado and other doctors to entice them to refer patients to the business. Those gifts included University of Kentucky basketball tickets, a gift basket and campaign contributions. Alvarado was not named as a defendant in the civil case and he was not charged with a crime." ... The Monroe (LA) News Star reports President Trump's Tuesday State of the Union address "played predictably well in Louisiana, even with" Gov. John Bel Edwards (D-LA), "which is no surprise considering the state remains a Trump strong-hold." Edwards, "mindful of his reelection campaign" this fall "as the lone Democratic governor in the Deep South, hailed the president's justice reforms that Edwards said mirrored his own in Louisiana. 'Happy to hear President Trump's commitment to criminal justice reform in the #SOTU,' Edwards said in a tweet. 'I was honored to join the President last year to discuss Louisiana's historic reforms, which enjoyed bipartisan support.'" ... The Jackson (MS) Clarion Ledger reports a Mason-Dixon poll of 625 Mississippi voters, taken Jan. 30-Feb. 1, shows state Attorney General Jim Hood (D-MS) leading Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R-MS) 44%-42% in a hypothetical matchup; 14% were undecided. In a similar poll taken in April of 2018, Hood held a five-point lead over Tate. In the GOP primary (400 Republican voters), Tate leads state Sen. Robert Foster (R-MS) 62%-9%. In its report on the poll, The Hill reported, "If retired Supreme Court Justice Bill Waller runs as an independent, Hood would cling to a similarly insignificant" 40%-38% edge "over Reeves. Waller takes [9%] of the vote in that scenario."
Senate.
Newsweek reports retired US Marine Col. Lee Busby (R-AL), "former vice chief of staff to General John Kelly," says "he's moving toward the 'line of departure' that if crossed, would see" him launch a 2020 bid to unseat Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL). In the 2017 special election to succeed ex-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Busby mounted an unsuccessful write-in campaign in the GOP primary which was ultimately won by ex-state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore (R-AL), who eventually lost to Jones in the special general election. ... The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports President Trump on Wednesday said in an interview that he doesn't think ex-state Rep. Stacey Abrams (D-GA), who narrowly lost to now-Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) in November, could unseat Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) in next year's election. The article says, "Hours after Abrams delivered a well-received rebuttal to Trump's State of the Union address on behalf of the Democratic Party, Trump said it would be a 'mistake' for Abrams to run against Perdue, one of his top Georgia allies, in 2020. 'I think it's a mistake for her to run against him because I don't think she can win,'" Trump said, adding, "David Perdue is an incredible senator, if you remember, and will be very hard to beat." USA Today reports Trump said "top Democrats, including Oprah and former president Barack Obama campaigned for Abrams but Republicans won 'fairly easily.'" McClatchy reports, "Asked what Trump thought of murmurs [Abrams] might jump into the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential primary field, the president smiled. 'That, I like even better. I'd love for her to run for president,' he said." The Hill reported, "Democrats are clamoring for...Abrams to" challenge Perdue "after her response to...Trump's State of the Union address became one of the best-received rebuttals in years." ... The Great Bend (KS) Post reports Rep. Roger Marshall (R) "resides in the US House now, but if it were up to his wife, he would definitely try to turn that seat into a spot in the US Senate." The congressman is weighing a 2020 bid to succeed retiring Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), "but Marshall's wife, Laina, feels he has to run." ... The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports President Trump on Wednesday said that ex-Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) "lost his re-election bid last fall because the Nevada Republican had been 'extraordinarily hostile' to him during the 2016 election and had alienated the conservative base. 'What happened with Dean Heller is, I tried for him,' Trump said during" an interview. However, Trump "said [his] hard-core voter base 'did not believe me. They wouldn't go for him.'" Heller was unseated by Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in November. The Nevada Independent reports, "Heller 'was hostile beyond normal politics and the hostility carried over unfortunately to the presidential run against crooked Hillary Clinton,' Trump continued."
House.
The Detroit News reports former MI12 Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) has entered hospice care after his prostate cancer metastasized. Dingell decided against further treatment and his family requests privacy going forward. ... The Columbia (SC) State reports a Trafalgar Group (R) poll of 2,479 SC1 likely GOP primary voters, taken Jan. 28-Feb. 1, "suggests primary voters would like to see some familiar faces" to take on freshman SC1 Rep. Joe Cunningham (D) next year, "but also suggests an opening for a new GOP candidate to emerge." Asked who they'd prefer to face off against Cunningham, ex-state Rep. Katie Arrington (R) - who unseated ex-SC1 Rep. Mark Sanford (R) in last year's GOP primary before losing to Cunningham in the general election - "was the top choice" at 26%, followed by Sanford at 23%; 22% were undecided. Meanwhile, state Sen. Tom Davis (R) drew 7%, followed by state Sen. Larry Grooms (R) at 6%, and state Rep. Nancy Mace (R) at 5%. With Sanford excluded from the poll, Arrington draws 31%. With Arrington excluded from the poll, Sanford draws 37%. Neither Arrington nor Sanford have announced their 2020 plans.

Highlight: They're chewing through our fences and car wires, frolicking around restaurant kitchens, taunting our canines-even in some of DC's priciest neighborhoods. Now the District is fighting back, devoting new dollars to the effort and deploying Pentagon-grade tools. Patrick Hruby embeds himself in Washington's war on Rattus norvegicus.  
Body




"Hold this. How much do you think it weighs?"
Will Crane hands me a plastic garbage bag, the kind you buy at     grocery stores, careful to have me grasp it by the top. The bottom hangs     low and limp. I think I know what's inside. I don't think I want to look,     and I definitely don't want to smell. I'm not even sure I want to tell you     about it-at least not if you're reading this over lunch.
"Nine," Crane says. "There's nine in the bag. And that's all     from last night."
Crane is talking about rats. Dead ones, to be precise. For     weeks, I've been immersing myself in Washington's War on Rats-not the     metaphorical ones scurrying around Capitol Hill, har har, but the real,     four-legged deal. Rattus norvegicus. The Norway rat. Better known     as the street rat, the sewer rat, the wharf rat, the city rat. The brown,     furry insurgents that gobble our trash, burrow under our parks and yards,     scurry through the shadows of our streets and nightmares like bewhiskered     little movie monsters and generally provoke a yuck-at-first-sight desire     to burn down your entire house upon seeing one of them anywhere in its     vicinity.
Along the way, I've seen rats chew through garbage cans and     scale the sides of brick buildings, learned about reproductive     proclivities that make rabbits look like monks, and listened in     horror-slash-laughter to dozens of no-freaking-way rat stories, the     terrible tales that too many Washingtonians have, including one from a     woman who trapped a rat in her mother's house near Eastern Market, hit it     in the head with a hammer, watched it fall into an open pipe, poured     boiling water down the pipe, and then finally had to "extract it, which     was definitely traumatizing."
In other words, I've seen and heard some stuff. Yet Crane's bag     leaves me speechless. It's a warm night in Foggy Bottom, a little before     9, and neighborhood-association president Marina Streznewski has been     leading me on a rat walk. She's shown me where her dog caught and killed a     rat. She's shown me where she saw a group of rats eating inside a trash     bag "make it look like the bag was dancing." She's bemoaned the     student-rented group house she labels "ground zero for the whole block,"     which sports three rat burrows in its front yard, right below an outdoor     table coated with beer drippings and dotted by empty red party cups. As if     to underscore the way rats can drive otherwise amicable blocks to civil     war, she introduces me to a neighbor who curses yet another neighbor who     allegedly "feeds the f---ing squirrels! Which feeds the f---ing     rats!"
Then she introduces me to Crane, the neighborhood's chief rat     foe. A 40-year-old human-resources worker who has lived in the District     since 1996, he's a late convert to the cause. When he was a kid, his pets     weren't dogs or cats but, yes, rats. "They are actually very cool     animals," he says. "But they are also associated with Black Death."     (Recent research suggests that fleas and lice, not rats, spread medieval     plague, but that's another story.) Now, as an adult whose pricey home is     in a rat-saturated part of a rat-saturated city, Crane has made up for     lost time. To keep the cool but filthy animals out of his house and yard,     he rebuilt his floors and walls and reinforced his wooden fence with     nine-inch-high corrugated-steel panels. When that wasn't enough, he     started laying out a nightly perimeter of back-yard snap traps, baited     with almonds and cashews. When that wasn't enough, he began drilling tiny     holes into the nuts, the better to secure them to the metal pedals that     spring the traps. "Otherwise, the rats will just take them off without     getting hit," he says.
Standing by the gate to his back yard, we can hear Rattus norvegicus dashing around in the nearby darkness. Crane lets out an     exasperated sigh. He tells me that rats chewed a hole in his fence, right     above the steel; that he can hear them squeaking outside his bedroom     window, night after night; that he feels he's being overrun.
That's when he breaks out the bag. "I trapped these rats [in     the bag] over four hours," he says. "Is that normal?" As he talks, Crane     flashes a thousand-yard stare-the empty, unfocused gaze of battle fatigue,     the lifeless eyes that say war is hell.
Probably, he's just looking over my shoulder for     rats.
Washington's man-versus-rodent clash is practically as old as     the city itself. Occasionally, it has escalated to shock-and-awe     levels-most notably when the federal government helped fund a "war on     rats" in the late 1960s and early '70s and flood-ed the District with more     than 100 pest-control workers.
More often, though, the skirmish has taken the form of a     low-level siege. Consider our most famous residence. In the late 19th     century, First Lady Caroline Harrison hired "a man with ferrets" to de-rat     the White House. More than a half century later, and despite the benefits     of modern, non-ferret-based sanitation, the war remained unwon; during the     Ford administration, a large rat chased the National Security Council out     of the Situation Room. At times, the vermin have turned otherwise     mild-mannered statesmen into savage killers: In the early 1990s, a rat     reportedly bit Barbara Bush's English springer spaniel, Millie. On another     occasion, the First Lady was swimming in the outdoor pool at 1600     Pennsylvania when a rat jumped in and was intercepted by President George     H.W. Bush, who, she later recalled, "drowned the beast" with a     pool-cleaning scoop.
Washington is apparently still in search of that kind of     gumption. In 2012, a suspected rat scampered in front of President Obama's     podium during a Rose Garden address. Last year, the pest-control company     Orkin ranked Washington as the nation's fifth-rattiest city-behind rodent     standard-bearers New York and Chicago but ahead of longtime stalwarts     Boston and Philadelphia-while 5,020 rat-complaint calls were made to the     District's 311 phone line, more than double the number in     2014.
I hadn't ever called 311 myself, mostly because until I started     reporting this story, I didn't know that the line handled complaints. Talk     about a missed opportunity. Earlier this year, two rats ran directly under     my dog, an avid and committed squirrel chaser, right outside my Tenleytown     condo building. One neighbor later told me rats had chewed through the     electrical wiring in his van (fun fact: the Earth-friendly, soy-based wire     coverings in many modern cars are believed to be tasty to rodents), while     another confessed that when he took his car in for a tune-up, mechanics     found chicken bones and rat droppings in the engine block.
But if there was a war on, I wanted to get to the     front.
So I signed up for the District's Rat Riddance & Rodent     Vector Control Academy, an annual two-day boot camp for health and     sanitation workers, private exterminators, concerned citizens, and anyone     else interested in the finer points of, well, raticide. Held at One     Judiciary Square and organized by Gerard Brown, the District's longtime     rodent-control manager, it's the kind of event where you learn that rats     can produce as many as 25,000 droppings and shed up to 1 million     individual hairs in a single year. Also, it's a good place to overhear     conversations between federal building managers and city health inspectors     that end with statements like Trust me, 'humane' might sound good, but not if you have a decomposing rat stuck in the wall of your cafeteria.
The star attraction is a man named Bobby Corrigan. A     67-year-old from New York City, he has a PhD in urban rodentology, which     is a real thing, and a spot in the Pest Management Professional Hall of     Fame, also a real thing.
"What is the biggest rat in DC you've ever seen?" Corrigan     scans the room, looking for hands. "Anyone?"
"Two pounds," says someone.
"One-point-six pounds," says some-one else.
"Ten pounds!" says a third person.
Everyone laughs. Corrigan shakes his head.
"If there are ten-pound rats in this city," he says, "I am     leaving on the next train."
Becoming what Brown calls the Michael Jordan of rodent control     wasn't Corrigan's original plan. "I wanted to be Jacques Cousteau," he     says. That changed one day at community college when an urban entomologist     subbed for Corrigan's oceanography instructor. "We started talking about     cockroaches, ants, mice, and rats," he says. "I went straight to the     registrar after class and asked if I could get a degree in     that."
Corrigan has helped public-health officials in Brazil, Japan,     and 46 states, and he once spent a night lying in a barn surrounded by     peanut butter, the better to take photographs of rats. He loves dispelling     myths, such as the notion of a ten-pounder. "The heaviest rat ever weighed     was one pound, eight ounces," he says. "People say, 'The rats of my ward     are as big as an alley cat!' No, you saw an alley cat. If anyone in here     comes up with a two-pound rat, I'm writing you a check for     $300."
Corrigan's war stories include one from the Pentagon, where     pest controllers found a snap trap containing a severed rat leg. "They     asked me, 'What's your professional opinion? Is it dead?' " Corrigan says.     "I said yes. A couple months later, I came back to teach a class. 'Bobby,'     they told me, 'you're not going to believe it. We trapped a rat with three     legs. We called him Stumpy.' "
I was hoping Corrigan would have good news-some reassurance     that while things might look bad, Stumpy's side was not, in fact, winning.     No such luck. "The Norway rat is on the rise globally," he says. "Every     city I've been to in the past five years is seeing more rats."
To illustrate, Corrigan gives us a field assignment: Break into     small teams and survey five areas around the building, looking for signs     of rats. My team includes Daryl, a private exterminator who used to work     in Army intelligence and now supervises anti-rat efforts at the Wharf in     Southwest DC, and Mike, a city pest controller who swears he once saw a     gang of rats "jump a dog." While Corrigan calls this a "blitz," I figure     the exercise will be uneventful-I've lived in Washington since the     mid-1990s, walked in and out of the Judiciary Square Metro station at     least a hundred times, and have never seen a rat in the area.
I am so, so wrong.
Under a tree across the street, we find three burrow holes in a     dirt patch about as big as a large desk. At the entrance to a parking     garage, we count 11 more holes, then trace rat "runways"-strips of bent     grass indicating regular, nightly movement-from the holes to nearby     garbage cans and hot-dog vendor carts.
Over the next hour, we spot burrows on every side of the     building. Burrows under the foundation of an adjacent homeless shelter.     Burrows just inside a nearby construction site. My notebook is filling up.     Outside a ground-floor bakery, we find a black bait box-only it doesn't     contain rat poison. Instead, it's stuffed with shredded cloth and aluminum     foil, as well as a candy-bar wrapper. "The rats are living in this one,"     Daryl says. "The foil is for insulation."
At one point, Daryl drops to the ground to reach under a parked     car. He emerges with a dead rat. It's big-maybe big enough to capture     Corrigan's bounty.
"Oh, God," says a passerby in a blue suit. "That's bigger than     a cat."
Back in class, Corrigan breaks the bad news-our rat is "gassed     up," bloated from the biochemical vapors released during postmortem     decomposition. His $300 remains safe.
Team by team, we present our findings. It turns out that one     large planter box adjacent to Judiciary Square's Metro escalators has 29     to 33 rat holes. Then it's time for some quick math. Rat burrows generally     have three holes-a front door for getting in and out, two back doors for     emergencies. So 30 holes means ten burrows. According to Corrigan, the     average burrow houses ten rats: a mom, a dad, and eight kids. Multiply ten     by ten, and that's 100 rats, all nesting in one box outside     one building next to one Metro station. "The rats in     this area," Corrigan says, "are really doing well."
Looking forward to your next jury-duty summons?
Gregory Cornes tells me to stand back. Clad in dark-blue pants     and a matching long-sleeved shirt, he's holding a device that looks like a     stripped-down Super Soaker and is full of rat poison. But Cornes isn't     warning me about accidentally inhaling it.
"Every once in a while," he says, "you hit a burrow and rats     shoot out."
We're standing in an alley in Northeast DC, near the corner of     Oglethorpe and Eighth streets. Cornes is here to treat the area-"treat"     being a nice way of saying search and destroy. One of eight city     exterminators, Cornes has worked in local government since 1985 and spent     much of the last 15 years out of the office driving around town in a     pickup truck to hunt rats. "I like this job better," he says with a grin.     "Dealing with rats, they don't talk back."
Cornes often ends up targeting alleys-in part because rats love     garbage and in part because they try to avoid the humans who create it.     He'll pump one to three ounces of the poison into burrows. The powder     sticks to their paws and fur; when they groom themselves, they unwittingly     ingest it. Three to seven days later, the rats die. If this seems like a     particularly fiendish way to go-a death wish ordered up by a Bond villain,     or Vladimir Putin-well, they kind of deserve it.
The property destruction alone. . . . Experts believe that     around one-quarter of all fires of unknown origin are caused by rats     chewing through wires. In 1967, a single rat at a Washington-area power     station caused a third of the District to lose power for 45     minutes.
Then there's (shudder) the health issues. A 2014 Columbia     University study found that rats "are reservoirs for a vast diversity of     microbes that may affect human health," including leptospirosis, a rare     bacterial infection that last year killed one New York City resident and     left two others hospitalized.
Poison is actually one of the more prosaic approaches to     mankind's war on rats. Examples of ingenuity used elsewhere include traps     such as the "T-Rex," which works like a guillotine and resembles a     dinosaur's mouth. Over the years, we've resorted to electrocution. We've     conscripted ferrets, dogs, and cats as allies in our struggle. A few years     ago, Chicago officials released 60 coyotes wearing radio collars onto the     city's streets. Sometimes, even our good old-fashioned poison efforts are     indistinguishable from actual warfare: New Zealand recently cleared     surrounding islands of rats by dropping poison from     helicopters.
Washington's current extermination efforts are somewhat less     extreme. The District has experimented with stuffing dry ice into rat     burrows in order to asphyxiate the inhabitants. Sometime soon, Brown tells     me, his exterminators will experiment with a sticky-sweet ingestible     liquid called Contra­Pest that renders rats infertile. The first field     trial of the drug, conducted in the New York City subway, reduced the     resident rat population by one-half over three months.
But like humans, rats have a way of keeping on. At the Rodent     Academy, Corrigan plays a video. Four snap traps are arrayed in a row. A     rat appears in the frame, whiskers twitching, curious and     hungry.
Snap! A trap fires, striking the victim square in the     head.
"Wait for it," Corrigan says. "Wait for it-"
Nothing. The rat is still. Has to be dead. Only suddenly, it     wiggles backward from the trap and runs away.
"Oh, Lordy Jesus!" someone says with a gasp.
Contrary to urban legend, rats cannot flatten their bodies like     pancakes to slip beneath doors. But they can fit through holes and cracks     bigger than 12 millimeters, the amount of space from the tops of their     skulls to the bottoms of their jaws. Their bites are mini weapons of mass     destruction. Armed with powerful facial muscles that can generate 6,000     pounds of force per square inch and teeth that are comparable in hardness     to iron, they can chew through wood, plastic, and metal (as in fences,     trash cans, and certain sewer pipes).
Because rats face perpetual danger, they've evolved to be both     smart and paranoid-"diabolically clever," according to a 1912 history of     British mammals. They make up for limited vision through superior smell     and touch, following familiar, safe paths marked by an oily,     pheromone-laden substance that sloughs off their fur and sticks to objects     that they brush against. While some rats have been measured roaming as far     as five miles in a single night, most are homebodies that prefer to remain     within a few hundred feet of their nests-i.e., the cozy living room     they've constructed next to your rain barrel.
One other exceptional behavioral quirk helps rats survive and     thrive. "A lot of copulations occur among rodents," as Corrigan likes to     say. He's being polite. According to the 2004 bestseller Rats by     Robert Sullivan, male and female rats may have sex as many as 20 times a     day, and a dominant male can hook up with as many as 20 females in a span     of six hours. In turn, those females have a gestation period of 21 to 24     days, give birth to litters of eight to 12 pups, and can get pregnant     again within 24 hours.
So yes: Right now, this minute, somewhere near you, rats     probably are getting it on.
Complicating matters, pioneering rat researcher David E. Davis     discovered in the 1950s that when some rats in a particular area are     eliminated, the survivors become bigger-and their pregnancy rates double.     "Removal," he concluded, "merely [makes] room for more rats."
Researchers estimate that under ideal conditions, one pair of     rats could produce about 15,000 descendants in a single year. (Luckily for     us, conditions are never ideal, not even in the alleys of Adams Morgan.)     It's a staggering number, and one that helps explain why rats have     followed us from their ancestral homeland in Mongolia to every continent     save Antarctica, why they survived multiple nuclear tests on the Marshall     Islands, and why Cornes and his colleagues have been treating the same     area off Oglethorpe Street for more than a year.
Marian Connolly can relate. At first, she stopped feeding her     songbirds because the rats ate birdseed. She poured concrete along the     bottom of her back-yard fence because the rats tunneled into the dirt. She     wrapped the decorative breeze blocks that make up her back-yard wall with     wire mesh because the rats were running through the holes. She bought an     ultrasonic generator to drive rodents away and an electrified trap to zap     any strays.
But the rats keep coming.
The sound machine did nothing-except irritate Connolly's     neighbor. The zap trap, she says, caught "one mouse and a bunch of     crickets." Every day, she checks her outdoor walkways for droppings,     scrubs them down with pine cleaner, and sprays them with peppermint and     eucalyptus oil-the better to eliminate the odor pathways rats use to     navigate. Nevertheless, the vermin continue to scamper through her garden,     dig into her flower pots, and climb under the siding of her Capitol Hill     home.
"My greatest fear is that they will somehow break through and     get inside," she says. "I feel like we are under siege."
Connolly has (human) company. A few blocks away by Barracks     Row, Linda Young has spent more than $12,000 tearing out bushes, sealing     off her deck, and otherwise fortifying her home into a rodent Green Zone.     "I've heard other people say they've spent $50,000," she says. "You have     to constantly be vigilant." Along Connolly's street, rats have chewed     through fences, garage doors, and the fuel line of a parked car; forced     one neighbor to tear out a deck and another to replace an entire yard with     concrete; turned up dead and decomposing on driveways and in planters; and     arrived as a party of four, alive and hungry, during an outdoor     dinner.
"Everyone screamed, stomped their feet, threw things at them,"     says Connolly, a 74-year-old federal retiree. "The rats just stood     there!"
Connolly doesn't blame the rodents. She blames people. And     she's not wrong. Though historically associated with Dickensian poverty,     rats in modern Washington are actually a byproduct of prosperity.     Connolly's Eastern Market neighborhood is booming, and more residents and     restaurants mean more garbage, which means more rat food. What's true     there is true across the city. Two years ago, the District was home to     681,170 people-a four-decade high-and the number of bars and restaurants     in the city increased by 31 percent between 2006 and 2016. Tourists aren't     doing us any favors, either. Earlier this year, city exterminator Idris     Ahmad's team began treating the Mall-including the Washington Monument,     where during his first visit he counted 132 burrows.
"The rats like funnel cake, man," he says.
Scientists hypothesize that shorter, warmer winters give rats     more time to breed-it turns out cold weather is one of the few things that     may slow the rapacious little sex monsters down-which also could explain     why they're surging.
Here's Corrigan's mantra: Sanitation is pest control. For     cities such as Washington, he says, killing rats is 20 percent of the     battle-at most. "How we do our trash is how we do our rats," he says. "If     we keep cleaning up, we put them under constant stress. They get killed in     fights with each other, they move out of neighborhoods, or they die of     starvation. When we control the food, we control the numbers."
Therein lies the challenge. Susan Sedgewick, Connolly's     neighbor, has labored over the last year to combat rats-scheduling regular     city exterminator visits, collecting permission forms from homeowners to     have their properties treated, and pressing the five restaurants that     share an alley with her block to manage their trash better. As you might     expect of someone who previously worked for both a congressional     investigatory unit and a federal agency best described as, um, Spy     Museum-friendly, she has even tracked burrow counts and rat sightings on a     clipboard.
For her part, Connolly says, "I've probably spent 100 hours on     this."
Two of the restaurants moved their dumpsters and grease traps     into outdoor sheds. Two others obtained new plastic garbage bins. Problem     is, the sheds aren't flush with the ground-rodents can easily scurry in     and out-and hungry rats already have chewed through the new bins. "We     should be showing better results," Sedgewick says. "All our efforts can     feel like a waste of time."
To prevent rat-attracting spillover, the city has installed 25     solar-powered, ref­use-compacting trash cans in Connolly's neighborhood     plus 400 sensor-equipped cans around DC that alert sanitation workers when     they need to be emptied. The District's rodent-control unit has five     health-code enforcement officers who inspect properties for     rodent-abetting conditions such as piles of back-yard junk-which rats like     to hide under-and issue commercial fines that start at $500, while the     Department of Public Works has 25 inspectors focused on waste. But the     scale of the job is vast. There are approximately 6,700 cans in     Washington, and the city removes about 95,000 tons of trash and 25,000     tons of recyclables annually. Last year, Public Works issued more than     10,000 garbage-related citations, a 17-percent increase from     2016.
During an inspection walk through Barracks Row with Ahmad and     his colleagues on a warm and sticky spring day, it becomes clear that some     of the responsibility is on residents. Eighth Street is a microcosm of     Washington's continuing gentrification: young parents pushing luxury-brand     strollers, slump-shouldered teenagers in skinny jeans carrying comically     overloaded backpacks, business types in rolled-sleeve button-downs eating     lunch outside.
But the alleys show the ugly innards of this scene. Trash cans     with chewed-through lids. Burrows under a tree next to a back yard dotted     with dog feces (an "energy bar" for rats, Corrigan says), just a few steps     from a restaurant grease trap. One restaurant has left its trash compactor     wide open. Another has a large pile of soggy cardboard boxes on its back     porch, which is currently attracting flies. A health inspector directs a     restaurant worker to clean up the mess. Somewhat incredibly, the worker     drags the boxes back into the restaurant.
"I'll ticket them for that," the inspector tells me. "But     here's what happens. We go to court, the restaurant explains it away, the     court reduces the fine. Then we come back out and it's the same people     over and over."
Across the street, we stumble across what appears to be home     base: 12 dumpsters lined up in a row behind a gas station. The ground     around them is strewn with trash. Everything reeks. Rats have burrowed     under the cracked pavement and into a weedy patch of dirt on the side of     an adjacent church. They've also chewed a forearm-size hole through the     roof of a nearby restaurant's outdoor refrigeration shed-giving themselves a straight shot into the kitchen. Surveying the scene,     Ahmad shakes his head: "We make it way too easy."
The District is trying to make it harder. Last year, Ward 6 DC     Council member Charles Allen introduced a bill that would require     restaurants to submit rodent-control plans to the city's health     department, encourage better trash and grease disposal, and reinvest fines     into the rodent-control budget. Brown, the District's rodent-control     manager, says his department is receiving $906,000 in additional funding     this year. Some of it will pay for more inspectors; the rest will cover a     pilot program deploying ContraPest, the new rat contraceptive, in a     notoriously infested alley behind a fast-food restaurant in Adams Morgan.     The District also is having its data-science team develop computer models     to predict where infestations are more likely to erupt.
Will it be enough? Connolly believes Allen's bill ought to     require restaurants to store trash indoors and use air scrubbers in     ventilation units, gold-standard rodent-control measures that restaurants     oppose for being expensive and unwieldy. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made     rodent control a more visible priority-personally going on neighborhood     rat walks and holding an all-hands-on-deck public meeting last year to     review and better coordinate the District's efforts. However, the city     still spends less than half of what Chicago does per resident per year on     rodent control-$1.91 versus $3.90-and Brown's upcoming budget bump is far     more modest than a $32-million rodent-reduction plan announced last year     by New York mayor Bill de Blasio. Moreover, our rat offensive is hamstrung     by a familiar local affliction-impotence via jurisdictional divide-as many     federal agencies employ their own pest-control services, often through     low-bid, high-turnover contracting. "You get what you pay for," Brown     says.
There's little doubt Washington could do more to combat     rats-but at what cost and for how long? In the 1960s, local activist     Julius Hobson caught rats, put them in a cage, drove to Georgetown, and     threatened to release them in wealthy, white neighborhoods unless the     government did more to exterminate rats in the poorer, predominantly     African-American areas of the District. A New York City activist emulated     his tactics in 1967, bringing a rat in a cage to Congress. Those stunts     helped spur $40 million in federal extermination funding, some of which     helped pay for the DC-wide "war on rats" of the 1970s. But subsequent     budget cuts gutted that program. Perhaps predictably, rat-related     complaints to the city between 1995 and 1999 rose by 20 percent. With     rodents back in the news, Mayor Anthony Williams that year held a     first-of-its-kind "rat summit" of national experts, presaging yet another     crackdown. It dissipated, too.
Thus two decades later, here I am, holding Crane's     bag.
I never do bring myself to look inside, although Marina     Streznewski later e-mails me a photo of its (a) very furry and (b) very     dead contents. Partly, this is because I'm well and truly grossed out.     Partly, it's because I don't need to see the casualties. By now, I know     the real enemy isn't at the grates.

Going on a weekly rat "blitz" with DC officials is a little like doing a dark tour of the city-inspectors and exterminators descend upon rodent-infested parts of town to crack down on garbage violations and blast rat burrows with poison-filled "dusters."

Highlight: New America set out to become a nonpartisan hub of policy ideas unencumbered by political or corporate influence. But a recent scandal over the encroachment of big business triggered something of an existential crisis, demoralizing many staffers-and prompting a debate about intellectual independence that touches think tanks all across Washington's vast ideas industry.

By Rachel M. Cohen
Anne-Marie Slaughter looked exhausted.
It was late summer 2017, and for the past week her Washington     think tank had been at the center of a national media scandal, beginning     with an embarrassing New York Times story about her firing of a     certain employee. Slaughter, the president and CEO of New America, had     been vacationing in Italy when the news broke. Now she was back, about to     confront her bewildered organization at an all-staff meeting and to try to     do some damage control.
The ousted staffer, Barry Lynn, was a critic of big tech     companies and headed Open Markets, a New America program on corporate     power and monopolies. Earlier in the summer, he had gone out of his way to     praise the European Union for fining Google $2.7 billion for antitrust     violations.
The chairman of Google's parent company at the time, Eric     Schmidt-who, along with his foundation and Google, had by that point     donated nearly $20 million to New America-was not pleased, Lynn told the     Times, and called Slaughter to say so. Lynn was informed that his     actions had endangered the institution, and he was ultimately     fired.
The debacle raised all sorts of questions about New America's     coziness with corporate funders, and as staffers gathered in the     conference room-across the lobby from the "Eric Schmidt Ideas Lab"-they     were impatient for answers. Many worried that the think tank's     intellectual integrity had been compromised, and they feared for their     reputations. What would happen the next time someone's work ran crosswise     with the interests of a big donor?
Instead of stanching the anxiety, Slaughter stoked it.     According to a recording of the meeting, she said that while she     recognized that the standard in journalism was never to show sources what     you were writing, New America's "norm can't be that. We're an organization     that develops relationships with funders. And you know, these are not just     black boxes; they're people. Google is a person, the Ford Foundation-these     are people. . . . And particularly when they give you money, which is     really a nice thing . . . basic courtesy I think requires-if you know     something really bad, you say, 'Here's a heads-up.' "
Things spiraled from there. Slaughter insisted that Lynn left     not because he had criticized Google but because of the non-collegial way     he'd handled himself. Many couldn't believe the contradictory responses     they were hearing. "The whole spectacle left me feeling really sick to my     stomach," recalls an employee who later left the organization. "It became     clear they were going to respond to this ordeal with a whole lot of     bureaucratic whitewashing."
Founded at the height of the Nasdaq boom, New America was meant     to be an antidote to other Washington think tanks-a young, nimble     provocateur that would dispense with convention and birth fresh ideas.     Nearly two decades later, the organization, which now employs more than     250 people, is casting about for relevance in a hyper-partisan era,     according to interviews with more than three dozen current and former     staffers, many of whom wanted anonymity for fear of retribution in the     tight-knit DC policymaking community. In a way, it's a symbol of an entire     Washington industry-policymaking-that's under pressure to fund itself     without making ideological or ethical sacrifices. If the Open Markets     episode became a public-relations debacle, it also alienated a swath of     the organization and exposed how much New America has outgrown its     earliest ambitions.
In Washington's ideas marketplace, New America was disruptive     long before that word became a cliché. In 1999, Ted Halstead, an ambitious     30-year-old who'd already founded an environmental think tank in     California, convinced media titan Bill Moyers to back a new kind of     research institute. Halstead's pitch: Washington's think tanks were known     for being captured by their donors, hobbled by bureaucracy, and too     partisan-what this town needed was a policy shop that would occupy, as     Halstead liked to call it, "the radical center."
Halstead and his cofounders saw New America as an amalgam of     bipartisan, nonpartisan, and post-partisan. They had a penchant for     economic populism and a distrust of the status quo. "The whole point of it     was to have a welcoming place for intellectual misfits, with the theory     that sometimes misfits know what they're talking about," says Phil     Longman, a longtime employee.
New America established different policy centers as well as a     "fellows" program for relatively unknown twenty- and thirtysomethings who     would plant their ideas in the mainstream press-a launching pad for the     next generation of public intellectuals. Jonathan Chait, a prominent     liberal writer for New York magazine, started there at age 26.     Other early fellows included Jedediah Purdy, today a Duke law professor,     and Jacob Hacker, now a political theorist at Yale.
The founders were just as insistent that their organization's     infrastructure be innovative, fashioning it after the New Economy     businesses of the era: agile, decentralized, and aggressively lean.     Program directors raised their own funds and paid a fraction of their     budget to the larger organization. The vibe was entrepreneurial, says Ray     Boshara, who joined in the early 2000s and later became a vice president:     "Every other organization I had worked for had all these centralized     functions. New America had this idea where we can hire all these people     who can do their own thing."
Within a few years, the think tank's fellows were regularly     appearing on the nation's most elite op-ed pages, liberal and conservative     alike, while its policy experts pushed out new ideas such as child savings     accounts. Donors, meanwhile, were clamoring to become patrons of the     iconoclastic upstart. Here again, New America differentiated itself by     corralling money from a new source: Silicon Valley.
Up to that point, tech entrepreneurs out west had largely shied     away from DC and its messy politics. "But the government is no longer     ignoring us, so we have to get organized," Eric Schmidt, then CEO of the     software firm Novell, explained at the time. In joining New America's     board of directors, Schmidt told the New York Times he didn't     necessarily expect the think tank to champion Silicon Valley's agenda. As     he put it, "The ideas that come out may well include some I might not     agree with."
After Ted Halstead stepped down in 2007, New America tapped     Steve Coll, a former managing editor of the Washington Post, to     succeed him. The choice adhered to the organization's taste for the     unconventional: No other think tank in town had a working journalist at     its helm.
The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, Coll made New America an     even more attractive place for writers and news outlets to affiliate with.     But a few of its original ideals began to get obscured during his     tenure.
In its earlier days, while New America did accept a small     percentage of donations from corporations and their foundations, its     leaders were generally leery of getting too friendly with businesses.     "Walmart tried to give me a million dollars, and we ended up saying no,"     Boshara recalls. "It was intriguing because we'd have access to data we     otherwise wouldn't, but I remember talking to Ted about how it might     compromise our brand and independence." Coll projected a similar     reticence. "As I remember it, the consensus was that we should remain wary     of corporations," he says.
After 2009, however, the think tank began landing US government     contracts, including millions of dollars' worth of work from the State     Department and the US Agency for International Development to help develop     covert wireless networks for dissidents in Iran, Syria, Libya, and Cuba.     Given that the organization had long prided itself on not being another     Beltway bandit feeding off federal agencies, this shift disturbed some who     worried that it signaled mission drift.
"I think government dollars automatically change the character     of an institution," says the Atlantic's Steve Clemons, one of New     America's first employees. "I was opposed completely, entirely, 9,000     percent. It dumbs down institutions, whether people want to believe it     does or not."
By 2012, New America's nonpartisan identity would come under     strain, too. That year, an internal civil war broke out over Fix the Debt,     a high-profile campaign that took a hard-line position on deficit     reduction, calling for cuts to Medicare and Social Security.
The campaign's co-chairs were a bipartisan duo: Democrat     Erskine Bowles, a chief of staff in the Clinton White House, and former US     senator Alan Simpson, a Republican. In one sense, it was the fullest     expression of the think tank living out its dream as a home for ideas of     all stripes. One day you might have a staffer from New America's     economic-growth program, which advocated for more federal infrastructure     investment, up on Capitol Hill making a pitch about major public     financing. The next day, a representative of Fix the Debt might say, "We     can't afford to do anything."
But in reality, the big tent created complications. Fix the     Debt was an enormous publicity generator for New America and was among its     biggest moneymakers. The majority of its funders, though, were     Republicans, including Wall Street tycoon Pete Peterson. And that caused     liberals in the organization to blanch at its association with the right.     Board member Bernard Schwartz, a major liberal donor who backed both the     economic-growth program and nearly all of the fellows program, became so     uncomfortable that he cut ties with the think tank. Eventually, Fix the     Debt and its parent program parted ways with New America, too. "Competing     pots of money and the political fashions of the day created an incoherent     organization," says one former staffer.
As much as the think tank professed to champion the "radical     center," in practice the mantra had shown its limits.
When Slaughter became CEO in 2013, the mood inside New America     turned jubilant. A former State Department official under Hillary Clinton,     she had earned a national following after her buzzy 2012 Atlantic     cover story about work/life balance, "Why Women Still Can't Have It All."     Staffers were also excited that Slaughter-a former Princeton dean-arrived     with serious academic credentials.
But she inherited some serious organizational dysfunction.     Building up the organization's administrative capacity hadn't been a     priority, even as New America had expanded. Ironing out the     infrastructural kinks would be her big test.
One of Slaughter's first orders of business was moving New     America from its modest downtown headquarters to a building a block from     the White House. The space had all the amenities of a DC power player: a     wrap-around roof deck with views of the Mall, trendy teal accents, and     sleek design. The upgrade of 20,000 square feet raised some eyebrows     internally, but Slaughter stressed that the extra space was essential. "It     embodies who we are and where we want to go and inspires us to get there,"     she declared.
Soon, like other think tanks in town, the institution would     confront new ethics challenges. Five months into Slaughter's tenure, a New     America policy analyst published a blog post criticizing a partnership     between Comcast and an online-education website. Despite objections from     New America program directors, according to an e-mail, Slaughter allowed a     senior VP at Comcast to write a defensive and self-congratulatory response     in the think tank's weekly newsletter. "That was one of the first     portraits many of us had of Anne-Marie's reflexes and instincts when she's     put in a position that requires confronting corporate power in some way,"     says a former staffer. Fuzz Hogan, New America's spokesman, says the     organization "failed to get comment from the subject of a story [Comcast]     so the editorial team determined a piece in response [by Comcast] was the     most effective and engaging solution."
Employees would get another portrait the next year when a New     America fellow named Steve LeVine was reporting an exposé on Sakti3, a     battery company. Its CEO called Slaughter to broach the idea of funding     New America but also voiced concerns about LeVine's reporting. Afterward,     Slaughter went to LeVine's editor to relay the CEO's objections. As word     of the conversation spread, staff felt that a line had been crossed.     Slaughter apologized to LeVine for interfering with the story.
Slaughter's political alliances also became news, in silly as     well as serious ways. In 2015, four months after Donald Trump decided to     run for President, Slaughter and a colleague met Ivanka Trump at an event     in DC. After chatting, Trump asked the women for their shoe sizes so she     could send each a pair of boots from her fashion line. They obliged, and     when the boots showed up in the mail, Slaughter and her colleague took     them home.
A year later, just before the election, WikiLeaks released     e-mails revealing that Slaughter had been collaborating informally with     Hillary Clinton's campaign. The e-mail traffic showed Slaughter trying to     persuade New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that the uproar     around Clinton's private e-mail use was overblown and that "everyone"     Slaughter knew at State also used private e-mail.
"Tom, I'm not working directly with Hillary's folks; I can't,     given my position as head of New America. So this reach-out is on my own     initiative," she had written. Friedman told her Clinton's e-mail situation     still didn't "sit right" with him. Slaughter forwarded their entire     exchange to three senior Clinton campaign advisers. "Fyi from Tom F-not     great, but useful to know," she wrote.
Embarrassing as the so-called "Ivanka boots" episode was, at     least the tarnish of that faux pas was internal-more of an inside joke.     The WikiLeaks incident, though, mortified a number of staffers. It's not     verboten for a think-tank CEO to advocate for a political candidate, but     New America had long prided itself on its nonpartisan stance.
As it was, stories were circulating that their boss was gunning     for a post in a Clinton White House and grooming their think tank for     Hillary's presidency. Since Slaughter took over, more than a dozen former     Obama administration appointees have joined the ranks. A couple, including     Cecilia Muñoz, Obama's top domestic-policy adviser, are among New     America's VPs.
New America "used to be a more accepting place of challenging     ideas outside the mainstream," says a right-leaning researcher who left in     2017. "Whatever tolerance existed is absolutely no longer there. It's not     even about being conservative, but it's about whether you're allowed to be     outside of this increasingly narrow Obama-coalition thing."
"We're not a government in waiting," says Peter Bergen, a VP.     "It's a big differentiator for us and continues to be."
Phil Longman, who worked at New America for 18 years until last     summer, says you could see the organization watering down its unorthodox     brand through its annual retreats. They used to be "freeform" gatherings     attended by staff and board members, "punctuated by highly competitive     rounds of touch football and also a fair amount of drinking," he says.     "But starting about ten years ago, these fellows retreats gave way to     highly formal, scripted sessions in which fellows, if they were allowed to     talk at all, were asked to put on dog-and-pony shows for would-be donors.     The most original and iconoclastic thinkers were generally left off the     program because, well, their ideas were 'unfundable.' Eventually, if you     weren't 'fundable,' you were gone."
Over time, a level of anxiety developed in some corners of the     organization, clouding the excitement that had marked Slaughter's hiring.     In particular, some worried about the organization's financial     footing.
For one thing, New America had beefed up its administrative     teams, adding staff in fundraising and other areas and expanding the     organization's central bureaucracy, a turnaround from its lean beginnings.     The number of staffers earning more than $100,000 in reportable     compensation jumped from 29 in 2014 to 49 by 2016, according to tax     filings. Slaughter earned $535,000 in 2015, her salary increasing 27     percent a year later to $677,000. (The president of the Center on Budget     and Policy Priorities, a think tank with comparable revenues, took home     $242,000 in 2016.)
There was also the cost of the upscale new DC headquarters.     According to financial audits, New America reported rent expenses of $1.3     million in 2014, the last full year it was in its old building, while rent     expenses for the new space amounted to $3.3 million in 2016.
Program directors were being asked to hand over more money     toward fixed costs. "The culture has really shifted in major ways over the     last five years, from a place where the center supports the programs to     one where the programs support the center," says Sascha Meinrath, a former     New America vice president who led its tech-policy program from 2008 to     2014.
While some level of administrative growth is necessary to     manage an expanding organization, many have had trouble accepting what     they see as outsize ambitions. At the all-staff meeting last September,     one employee asked Slaughter if it was a mistake to relocate to the new     building. "It's not putting pressure on our fundraising, and we had to     move," she responded.
It turns out some of the fear may not necessarily have been     unfounded. According to internal budget documents, as the organization     laid out its 2017 budget, it was seeing red. Revenues had been jumping,     from $14 million in 2008 to $38 million by 2016, according to its public     tax filings. But so had expenses. Going into 2017, New America was     privately forecasting that expenses would badly exceed revenue, leading to     a projected drop of $11 million in net assets. Not helping matters was     that the organization has no endowment.
Slaughter and her team downplay the concerns, stressing that     New America ended up reducing its central-functions budget and exceeding     its fundraising goal in 2017. "Nearly doubling revenues means a lot of     people have confidence in you," Slaughter told me this past winter. "It     means foundations and individuals are investing in you, so to me that's     the most important metric."
But it's not hard to see how anyone in this position wouldn't     have been keen to alienate a big donor.
The souring between Slaughter and Barry Lynn began in mid-2016.     Lynn's Open Markets program, which studied tech giants such as Amazon and     Facebook, was organizing a conference where Democratic senator Elizabeth     Warren would deliver a keynote on the drawbacks of corporate     concentration. Slaughter and the think tank's chief fundraiser, Meredith     Hanley, grew increasingly alarmed by the prospect.
"Just THINK how you are imperiling funding for others,"     Slaughter e-mailed Lynn days beforehand, emphasizing that they were "in     the process of trying to expand our relationship with Google." New America     had recently increased its donations from big business; 12 percent of     revenues came from corporations in 2016, up from 5 percent in     2014.
Slaughter demanded in an e-mail that Lynn provide her with     talking points to explain to Google why New America hadn't given it more     notice about the conference. Lynn wrote back that the event had been     announced publicly and that it had never been standard practice to alert     companies about forthcoming events or articles.
That episode ended in a détente. But then Slaughter lost     patience with Lynn for good last summer after the EU nailed Google on     antitrust violations and Lynn issued his laudatory statement. The release     caught the attention of Politico, which cranked out a story noting the     strange-bedfellows situation-New America cheering the punishment of a     company whose former chairman, Schmidt, was New America's chairman     emeritus.
According to e-mails, Slaughter informed Lynn he was being     fired for his "repeated violations of our institutional norms and values     concerning notice and cooperation when things that one program does     affects other programs." In other words, not giving a sufficient heads-up     to colleagues about what his program was doing. Slaughter said she'd give     Lynn two months to quietly spin off his Open Markets program, along with     its eight full-time employees: "We will also agree on a common narrative     on why this is happening that involves no disparagement by us of you or by     you of us."
But Lynn wasn't having any of it-he went to the Times     with the story, and the drama spilled into public view.
By the time Slaughter returned from her trip to Italy and     convened her staff meeting, many employees were not only bewildered-they     were embarrassed by their organization's bumbling, defiant     response.
"This story is false," Slaughter had tweeted the morning the     article was published. Several hours later, she tweeted that the "facts     are largely right" but the "interpretation is wrong." After getting     blasted on social media for the vague and tone-deaf responses, she issued     a full statement two days later, asserting that Lynn had not been fired     because of pressure from Google and apologizing for using Trumpian     rhetoric to discredit the Times.
Slaughter also pointed to a forthcoming book by one of its then     fellows, Franklin Foer. World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Techargues that Silicon Valley poses a threat to civil     society.
The invocation took Foer by surprise. A few months earlier, as     he'd been preparing for the book's release, he'd sensed the think tank was     backing away from it. First, he says, the organization informed him that     his New York book event would no longer be primarily hosted by New America     and that the viewpoints represented on the panel would need to be     "balanced." Foer had attended many other New America book events and knew     "balance" was not a typical requirement for what are mainly celebratory     events for fellows. Still, he agreed to the conditions.
"But after the fact," he says, "I learned that the development     officer, Meredith [Hanley], had a meeting where she freaked out about the     prospect of my book causing blowback for New America from Google and was     putting pressure on the fellows program to try to somehow dampen their     association with it."
Then came the Open Markets brouhaha, and suddenly, Foer says,     "after running away from my book, they started to run towards it in an     effort to launder their reputation." (Foer now sits on the board of the     Open Markets Institute, Lynn's splinter organization.) A spokesman for New     America says, "The people who did attend the meeting Frank heard about     secondhand have a different recollection, but the fact is we like Frank,     we like his work, we funded the writing of his book, and we promoted it     heavily. We believe it is critical to the conversation."
It's not as if New America was alone in its interactions with     corporations. Brookings and others have been called out in recent years     for alleged coziness with funders. For its part, New America has said it     doesn't allow donors to influence its work. "We have never had an instance     of a funder shaping what we do," Slaughter told her staff in     September.
That month, the think tank's board hired a management     consultant named Jon Huggett to interview nearly 40 people affiliated with     the organization. He found that most employees he spoke to felt confident     about the organization's intellectual independence and that Lynn's     departure wasn't seen as due to funder pressure. "Barry behaved     rationally, for himself," said one. In the end, Slaughter retained the     backing of the board-one of its co-chairs at the time suggested in a     letter to staff that Lynn had used New America as a scapegoat to advance     his own interests.
The organization also conducted a separate, internal review     around its funding and transparency practices. As a result of both     efforts, it is now disclosing dollar amounts and funding purposes for each     of its donors, not just who gives. These changes have earned the think     tank praise and higher scores from transparency watchdogs.
Less clear is whether staffers owe donors advance warning about     work they might not like. According to Kevin Carey, the VP who led the     internal committee, the organization chose not to adopt an official policy     on the matter. For some, this left questions around Lynn's firing still     open to interpretation, as well as ambiguity over whether higher-ups could     interfere with their work directly or indirectly through a culture of     self-censorship. Eventually, several fellows left.
Huggett, the consultant, meanwhile, found that the crisis     opened other wounds and that general morale had been clobbered. He told     the board he "heard more reasons to back New America from two funders than     [from] 30 staff." Few could speak of a shared mission, and others raised     concerns about rising costs and dysfunctional company culture. "We are     reactive and opportunistic," a staffer told Huggett. One founder said:     "Money, not mission, drives New America."
So how do you redefine a nonpartisan think tank in a     hyper-partisan age? James Fallows, a longtime board member, says New     America is working to figure that out: "You can't just split the     difference between sensible Democratic positions and sensible Republican     ones anymore, as you still could do in many areas in the 1990s. The room     for finding common ground in Washington has been cut away."
Whereas it used to play up its distinctiveness, the     organization looks more like a follower these days. Its leaders are     working on expanding its influence beyond Washington with on-the-ground     partners in local communities and "what works" research and events-a     popular, apolitical movement embraced by other policy institutes and     foundations over the last five years.
Some still feel anxious about the think tank's finances and     future. The organization has had four CFOs in the past five years, and     there was an abrupt leadership shake-up on the board last November. While     New America has had continued success raising restricted funds for     program-specific initiatives, like most nonprofits it has a harder time     raising unrestricted dollars. In 2016, an internal committee was tasked     with reviewing the organization's finances, out of recognition, they said,     that winning more program grants does not necessarily leave enough money     to cover the organization's fixed costs. Their recommendations to the     board included growing more policy programs as well as increasing New     America's corporate-donor pipeline by 30 to 40 prospects annually. (In     2017, 8 percent of funding came from big business.) While the committee     noted that the organization was staying afloat thus far by increasing     board support and netting big gifts, this was "not a long-term     strategy."
New America's leadership chalks up the criticism and     institutional snags to the inevitable growing pains of expansion. It's     "going through the natural life cycle of any organization," says Bergen.     Think about it as you might a college evolving into a university with a     collection of professional schools, Fallows suggests: "A bigger     organization just means more complexity of everything."
Right-sizing may depend on a degree of openness that some     believe has been missing. New America has a "social compact" stating that     it encourages "fearless feedback" and "frank conversations"-but the     management consultant heard varying comments including "I raise concerns     and am branded as a trouble maker" and "We do stifle internal critics:     Sometimes we fire them." Moreover, despite New America's stated values     around transparency, when the think tank negotiates severance packages, it     includes non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements-something few     people can afford not to sign.
The organization says it has been working on implementing     recommendations put forth by the consultant, including writing clearer     policies around collegiality. Huggett also suggested that New America     establish a committee on "reputation and risk" and make clearer to donors     that it will maintain editorial independence, both of which it has done.     When asked about the institution's expectation for notifying funders with     a heads-up about things that might upset them, a practice Barry Lynn     violated, Slaughter insists there was never a rule around that. "The thing     I will say is I love Barry's work. I've cited it and I believe in it," she     adds. "By far the worst part of everything that happened is we lost that     work."
New America has grown in size and scale under Slaughter. One of     her goals was to help Washington be more in touch with solutions-oriented     enterprises outside the Beltway, and she has positioned New America to try     to support innovators in cities and states and connect them to one     another. Last year, the think tank welcomed its first class of     public-interest technology fellows with data-science expertise, launched a     master's program in global security with Arizona State University, and     opened New America Indianapolis, one in a series of local initiatives.     Slaughter says she's proud of helping diversify the organization and of     building "a living, breathing network . . . composed of partners and     projects and institutions and people all around the country."
Slaughter has committed to at least five years with the     organization, and her half-decade anniversary is coming up this fall.     Whether she stays or moves on, the head of the think tank founded to     innovate will have to tackle some old-fashioned problems. As one employee     interviewed by the management consultant put it: "My biggest hope for New     America is to figure out what it wants to be when it grows     up."

Generics Spending Declined in 2017, IQVIA Reports
FDAnews Drug Daily Bulletin
April 24, 2018 Tuesday

Generics spending dropped $5.5 billion in the United States in 2017 due largely to competition and price decreases, according to the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science report, Medicine Use and Spending in the U.S. A Review of 2017 and an Outlook to 2022.
Generic prices fell an average of 6.3 percent after increasing from 2013 to 2015, while generic dispensing accounted for 90 percent of prescriptions compared to 72 percent in 2008.
Increases in generic approvals by the FDA, which hit an all-time high last year, led to price reductions of $5 billion.

Gottlieb Discusses New Guidance for Medical Software
Congressional Quarterly HealthBeat
April 26, 2018 Thursday

 Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Length: 633 words
Body




Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Thursday announced the agency will release several new sets of guidance aimed at speeding innovation in the fast-moving space of digital health.
The upcoming guidance will clarify questions such as where and how the department reviews tools like medical software and artificial intelligence, which are increasingly incorporated into prescription drug development and telehealth tools like mobile apps.
"We must give companies and investors the regulatory predictability they need to make the long-term investments, and take the significant risks, that innovation requires," Gottlieb said in a speech to the annual Health Datapalooza conference hosted by AcademyHealth.
FDA will be unveiling new guidance aimed at broadening inclusion of software in drug development, acknowledging the increased use of software to monitor things like patients' drug adherence and adverse side effects. Gottlieb said the department will open up a "public docket" for suggestions in this area.
He also announced future guidance on artificial intelligence and machine learning that will allow qualified manufacturers to make certain tweaks to their products without submitting additional applications. But Gottlieb cautioned that the FDA remains committed to ensuring the safety of new technologies even as the department moves to react more quickly to the rapidly changing arena.
"The technology won't be scaled or reimbursed without that level of confidence that it protects and promotes patients," he said.
Gottlieb also unveiled a new submission process that allows manufacturers to submit premarket safety reports in digital data sets, replacing the old paper and PDF process. The move will save hundreds of administrative review hours every month, Gottlieb said.
Another guidance memo released Thursday addresses multi-function devices, such as a heart monitor that transmits patient data into an electronic health record. The new guidelines state that the department will only review the heart monitor function, provided that the manufacturer proves the transmission function doesn't negatively impact its monitoring capacity.
"Our goal is to allow developers to efficiently incorporate into their products the latest advances in technology, while focusing FDA's review on the safety and effectiveness of the higher-risk medical device functions that diagnose or treat patients," Gottlieb said. "We believe this approach will encourage more innovation in this important field."
He also unveiled a working draft model of a precertification pilot to evaluate and regulate medical devices. The department is seeking input on the model from industry experts and the public, with the goal of launching a preliminary version by the end of the year.
"Your feedback is key to its success," Gottlieb said.
Additionally, FDA is launching a "data science incubator" in partnership with private organizations to aid research into new breakthroughs in treatments for diseases like cancer, he said. The incubator will, among other things, identify trends in tumors through the use of medical imaging.
The moves are the latest part of FDA's initiative to improve regulatory processes surrounding digital health. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has designated the removal of regulations he says impede such innovation as one of the department's top priorities.
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma is also taking steps to overhaul patient access to their medical records and pricing information while revamping electronic reporting requirements for hospitals. Verma is also expected to introduce new data initiatives at the conference later Wednesday.

Morning Take: Markup Preparations and Drug Prices
Congressional Quarterly HealthBeat
April 20, 2018 Friday

 Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Length: 1169 words
Body




TOPLINES
1. Next Week -- Committees are poised to vote on opioid packages and begin to prepare spending bills.
2. Drug Prices -- Ahead of White House push on drug prices, a report reviews the elements of drug spending.
3. Budget Wanes -- Senate Republicans are wary of a budget resolution and the reconciliation process is not an alluring option this year.
MORNING TAKE
1. Opioid Markups and Spending Bills
The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on April 24 will markup a consolidated opioid crisis response package (S 2680, view draft text and summary). The committee will also consider bills updating the over-the-counter drug regulatory process (S 2315), reauthorizing payments to graduate medical education programs (S 2597) and creating a firefighter cancer registry (S 382). The next day, the House Energy and Commerce health panel will consider more than 60 opioid response measures.
- CQ News (04/19) -- Senate Finance Kicks Off Its Opioid Debate
Also, the Senate Appropriations Agriculture-FDA subcommittee will examine the Food and Drug Administration budget request. The House panel, in a hearing with FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb this week, indicated it may be difficult to substantially hike funding for the agency. Later in the week, the House Labor-HHS subcommittee hears viewpoints from public witnesses about funding for health care agencies. Appropriators, as early as next week, could begin markup action on the Military Construction-VA spending bill funding the veterans' health care system.
Other hearings next week include a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee review of the nomination of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to be VA secretary. The House Ways and Means Committee plans sessions on efforts to stop the flow of synthetic opioids in the international mail system and health care innovation.
2. Focusing on Drug Prices
President Donald Trump next week plans to deliver an address on drug prices. The speech is expected to highlight the administration's previously suggested changes to Medicare and Medicaid incentives and payment policies (view fact sheet), plus a call for additional drug pricing ideas.
A report released Thursday by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science offered some interesting data on drug spending. The study indicated that in 2017, spending on all medicines grew by 0.6 percent on a net basis to $324 billion.
Various groups weighed in to parse different aspects of the report. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a group representing pharmacy benefit managers, highlighted the 2.1 percent decline in retail and mail/specialty pharmacy spending, while non-retail, such as hospitals, grew by 5.9 percent. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America noted that prices for brand-name drugs increased 1.9 percent, after negotiated discounts and rebates. The American Medical Association pointed to a sharp decrease in opioid prescriptions nationwide, but noted that has been matched with an increasing number of deaths related to heroin and illicit fentanyl.

3. Senate Budget Enthusiasm Wanes
The congressional budget resolution, the annual legislative ritual that assured passage of the 2010 health care overhaul law and allowed votes in 2017 on repealing the law, is doubtful for 2018. The budget plan sets spending bill targets, which have already been set by last month's budget compromise. The budget resolution also allows for reconciliation bill action -- that avoids Senate roadblocks -- to adjust mandatory spending. Reconciliation rules enabled the Democrat-led 2010 final vote on the health law. However, reconciliation allowances are not necessary this year, due to GOP wariness over last year's health law repeal effort.
House Republican lawmakers recently noted some willingness to address a budget proposal, but some GOP senators are wary of even considering one. Sen. John Boozman, a Budget panel member, said Thursday that as far as he knows the committee won't be moving forward with a budget anytime soon. "My understanding is we're not moving forward in that direction," he said.

Morning Take: Rescissions and Opioids
Congressional Quarterly HealthBeat
June 5, 2018 Tuesday

 Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Length: 1279 words
Body




TOPLINES
1. Rescissions -- White House prepares to adjust package of spending changes, likely keeping CHIP rescissions but removing Ebola cuts.
2. VA Spending -- Senate panel begins work on fiscal 2019 veterans' health care spending.
3. Opioids -- Looming crisis response package will not be the end of legislative effort on opioids. 
MORNING TAKE
1. Administration plots rescission adjustments 
The Office of Management and Budget is poised to adjust a request for $15.2 billion in rescissions to selected spending. The primary proposed rescission will likely remain: $7.1 billion in cuts to the Children's Health Insurance Program and associated contingency funds for states experiencing CHIP shortfalls. However, $252 million that was previously appropriated for anti-Ebola efforts -- and eyed for cuts -- likely will be omitted from the new proposal.
Even if the White House formally submits changes to its request, the package could still face difficulty passing the House and Senate. Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the request and the House rescissions bill (HR 3) has stalled, in part, because of resistance from rank-and-file Republicans. Senate Republicans have introduced their own rescissions package (S 2979) that mirrors the House proposal, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the Senate will wait for the House to move first.
The administration insists CHIP funding cuts will not impact the number of children who gain access to health care through the program. But there is concern that voting to cut previously approved spending could play badly in campaign ads -- especially in moderate districts Republicans are trying to hold on to in November. Retaining the unused Ebola funding likely anticipates possible additional dollars to address a new Ebola outbreak in central Africa.
2. Senate appropriators prepare a veterans' health spending measure.
A Senate Appropriations panel today marks up its fiscal 2019 Military Construction-VA spending bill to fund the veterans' health system. Senate appropriators have pegged the funding level for the bill at $97.1 billion, which is 5.5 percent higher than fiscal 2018. The separate House measure (HR 5786), which awaits a floor vote this week in a three-bill omnibus spending bill package, offers $71.2 billion in funding for veterans' health care.
3. Opioid response: More to come
The House is moving forward this month on opioid crisis response legislation, and CQ Weekly's cover story Monday analyzed the debate. Committee spokeswoman Jennifer Sherman commented to CQ that Congress has already cleared laws intended to curb opioid abuse, spur medical research and provide $4 billion in funding for efforts to fight the opioid epidemic. She said the panel will stay focused on the issue after the legislative package clears.
"The current Congressional efforts are not the first actions taken to stem the tide of the opioid epidemic, and they won't be the last," said Sherman. "The Energy and Commerce Committee has long prioritized this fight and has been working to combat the opioid crisis since 2012.... Knowing the crisis isn't over, we picked the pen back up and have advanced 57 bills -- 56 of which passed by bipartisan votes. Combating the opioid crisis has long been a top priority for this committee, and we will continue to devote our time and attention to seeking legislative solutions to this scourge. Even after the ink dries on the President's signature on our latest proposals we will continue developing ways to stem the tide of addiction and save lives."
Chairman Greg Walden previously said about the effort: "It's the biggest package of bills ever before the committee, and they're bipartisan, almost all of them. I just think it's really important public policy at a time when a thousand people a day are ending up in emergency rooms overdosing on opioids."

State Department Launches $40 Million Counter-Propaganda Program
The White House Bulletin

Length: 190 words

The State Department is launching the Information Access Fund and a series of pilot projects developed with and funded by the US Department of Defense to counter propaganda and disinformation from foreign nations. The two agencies signed an agreement transferring $40 million of fiscal year 2018 funding from the Defense Department to the State Department, according to a Monday announcement. The Information Access Fund will provide grants to public and private partners - including civil society organizations, NGOs, media providers and content creators - and "drive the use of innovative messaging and data science techniques," according to the announcement. "This funding is critical to ensuring that we continue an aggressive response to malign influence and disinformation and that we can leverage deeper partnerships with our allies, Silicon Valley, and other partners in this fight," said Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Steve Goldstein in a prepared statement. "It is not merely a defensive posture that we should take, we also need to be on the offensive," he added. - Bulletin exclusive from US News

The White House today released an information sheet on President Obama's proposals to provide young Americans job training and skills to prepare them for their first job. The White House says Obama's FY 2017 budget "includes nearly $6 billion in new funding to help more than 1 million young people gain the work experience, skills, and networks that come from having a first job." 
The White House and the Departments of Labor and Education say the plan nearly doubles "last year's budget request for supporting young people who are out of school and work." The information sheet lists the major components of the proposal, including: -- The Administration is proposing new investments "to connect more than 1 million young people to first jobs over the summer and year-round. It would also create a new $2 billion competitive grant program designed to re-connect disconnected youth to educational and workforce pathways." -- The Administration is releasing "the application for a $20 million Department of Labor grant competition - using existing funds - that will award approximately 10 grants to communities to implement innovative approaches that connect young people to jobs and career pathways." -- The President is also proposing " $3 billion to create an American Talent Compact that would expand talent pipelines in over 50 regions to fill open jobs and attract new jobs from overseas; a $500 million Workforce Data Science and Innovation Fund to create dynamic data sets on jobs, skills, and training to help training providers and workers keep pace with rapidly changing job needs; and a $2 billion Apprenticeship Training Fund to double the number of US apprenticeships."

President Obama today participated in a panel at the White House Summit on Precision Medicine today, where he delivered remarks. In an information sheet, the White House says that last year, the President signed "bipartisan legislation providing more than $200 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative. Today, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is making the first awards under this initiative to begin to build a national, large-scale research participant group. This will be a participant-engaged, data-driven research effort at the intersection of human biology, behavior, genetics, environment, data science, and computation aimed at developing more effective ways to improve health and treat disease. NIH, in partnership with the Health Resources and Services Administration, also will collaborate with community health centers to expand the reach of the Precision Medicine Initiative in under-served communities."
The White House also announced the following specific new awards, programs, and guidance: -- The National Institutes of Health announced "an award to Vanderbilt University in collaboration with Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences) to launch the first phase of the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort, which will lay the foundation for a national community of 1 million or more US volunteers who will partner with researchers, share data, and engage in research to transform our understanding of health and disease through precision medicine." -- The National Institutes of Health "announces that it is working in collaboration with the Health Resources and Services Administration to begin partnerships with several health centers to develop, pilot, and refine approaches to engaging under-served and underrepresented individuals, families, and communities around participating in the Precision Medicine Initiative Cohort." -- The National Institutes of Health, "in collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, will coordinate 'Sync for Science' pilots through an open standards development process with electronic health record developers Allscripts, athenahealth, Cerner, drchrono, Epic and Mckesson." -- The White House is "releasing for public comment the draft Data Security Policy Principles and Framework for the Precision Medicine Initiative." -- The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, "in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will, by December 2016, develop a precision medicine-specific guide to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework." -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is "partnering with the Department of Defense to expand the VA's MVP, a participant-driven research cohort with more than 450,000 veteran enrollees, to facilitate the enrollment of active duty men and women into MVP." -- The Food and Drug Administration is launching "its first precisionFDA challenge, which will use the new precisionFDA platform to encourage the genomics community to advance quality standards and achieve more consistent and accurate DNA test results, advancing the goal of better personalized care." -- The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights "today issued additional guidance on individuals' rights to access their health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."

Get used to it if you're not a nerd  -  the talk of "data science" in health policy circles is probably never going away.
"I can tell you this topic consumes us as we gather around the table with the 27 institute directors and myself," National  Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told a Washington, D.C. audience Tuesday.
Collins appeared with other top Department of Health and Human Services officials at the third and final day of "Health Datapalooza," an annual event  hosted by federal officials to help incubate new software products by releasing troves of of Medicare claims, genomic data, and adverse drug event information.
Officials spent no small amount of time emphasizing how open they've been with data and how open they plan to be.
"The information oligarchy... is a thing of the past at the department of Health and Human Services," declared Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. "We can proudly say we've grown into an open data democracy."
"We have arrived, and boy have we arrived, with a whole variety of types of data," Collins said, pointing to genomic data, complex imaging and clinical information increasingly generated by electronic medical records .
"All of these data types have to be a concern for us in terms of how to collect them, how to store them, and how to make them accessible to the broadest range" of users,  he said.
Collins spoke to the open culture of big data he is trying to nurture by noting the massive international project he oversaw to decode the human genome.
 "Obviously the investigators doing this work were basically agreeing to give away their information without worrying too much about who got the credit," Collins recalled. "They wanted the best and brightest minds of the world to begin working on it right away."
Collins said the open access mantra has prompted a movement in biomedical research that's spilled into other fields. 
The NIH National Center for Biotechnology Information allows the public to download not only genomic information but clinical research results.  "We're up now to 4 million daily users, daily downloads of 35 terabytes. We have certainly arrived here in the big data zone," Collins said.
NIH still has more to do, Collins said. He recently named a new associate director for data science and a data council with representatives from each NIH institute. NIH also plans to fund centers of excellence in data science and establish a virtual "data commons" where data can easily be accessed on line.  
The institution is also taking part in a new national clinical research network that pools together 26 million patients from 11 health care delivery systems. It  will allow for "observational trials almost immediately and almost for free,"  he said, and for randomized controlled clinical trials of unprecedented scope and size.
HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius amplified the calls and was introduced as a staunch supporter of the data liberation movement. She said the first Datapalooza five years ago attracted a group of 45 people. "This gathering is going to grow bigger every year,"  Sebelius predicted, noting the HHS release of additional new data on hospital charges and of FDA data on drug side effects.
If all the talk  about the potential of data seemed a bit too vague and self-congratulatory, conference organizers had an answer:  awards for teams given the challenge of developing apps from the big release in April of Medicare physician billing data.
  Winners included karmadata.com, with an app to find the best doctor based on the number of procedures performed; Accordion Health with an app to help patients predict future health costs, and Lyfechannel, with an app to equip patients with cost data to negotiate with doctors what they charge for a particular service.
 "Data science will do more for medicine than all the biological sciences combined," entrepreneur Vinod Khosla told conference attendees.

National Institutes of Health: Big money for Big Data

The National Institutes of Health will spend up to $24 million a year for the next four years to establish research centers aimed at improving the scientific community’s ability to meaningfully work with large, complex data sets, the agency announced Monday.
NIH will fund six to eight Big Data to Knowledge Centers of Excellence, which will be created and led by chosen applicants. Applications are due Nov. 30.
The Centers of Excellence will focus on developing innovative methods, software and other tools to share, analyze and manage the massive amounts of data being collected by and for medical researchers. Teams will work to create new technologies and establish new standards and best practices for data usage that would then be disseminated throughout the biomedical community.
NIH officials intend to involve experts from outside the biomedical field who have experience with data science and envision the centers working as a consortium.
“This funding opportunity represents a concerted effort to leverage the power of NIH in developing cutting-edge systems to address data science challenges,” NIH Director Francis S. Collins said in a statement. "The goal is to help researchers translate data into knowledge that will advance discoveries and improve health, while reducing costs and redundancy. ”
As technologies advance, data plays an increasingly central role in medical discoveries. The capabilities to harness, navigate, manipulate and apply those massive data sets are therefore essential for researchers. (To read more about the role of data in the medical community, check out The Daily Record’s three-part series, “The health IT evolution. ”)
But developing those specialized skills takes deliberate effort; it can’t be an afterthought.
That’s why the NIH launched the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative in December. BD2K supports data science research, as well as training to give biomedical researchers the tools and skills necessary for analyzing the data they collect, as well as locating and using data collected by others.
The available money for the Centers of Excellence is the BD2K initiative’s first funding opportunity. More will be announced in coming months.
“BD2K aims to enable a quantum leap in the ability of the biomedical research enterprise to maximize the value of the growing volume and complexity of biomedical data,” Eric Green, acting associate director for data science and director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, said in a statement. “The Centers of Excellence will provide a key component of the overall initiative. ”

Howard Cohen has stepped down from his position as chief health counsel at the House Energy and Commerce Committee, committee aides said Thursday.
As a member of the majority staff, Cohen worked to bring attention to problems that Republicans saw in the health care law (PL 111-148-PL 111-152). He also focused on how to rein in costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs as well as health policy issues, including the troubled payment system for Medicare doctor reimbursements.
Cohen is a Hill veteran who started out in 1989 working on minority committee staff. He left the Hill and in 2001 formed his own firm, HC Associates, and rejoined House Energy and Commerce in 2011.
The National Institutes of Health is looking for someone to fill a new position, associate director for data science.
This associate director will spearhead a series of NIH-wide strategic initiatives designed to capitalize on the exponential growth of biomedical research data, such as from genomics, imaging and electronic health records, NIH Director Francis Collins said in a news release announcing the position. Collins recently charged a working group of the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director to examine the growing data and informatics challenges associated with biomedical research. One of the major recommendations made by that working group in June 2012 was the creation of a new NIH leadership position focused on data science.
"There is an urgent need and increased opportunities for advanced collaboration and coordination of access to, and analysis of, the rapidly expanding collections of biomedical data," Collins said in a statement. "NIH aims to play a catalytic lead role in addressing these complex issues -- not only internally, but also with stakeholders in the research community, other government agencies, and private organizations involved in scientific data generation, management and analysis."
While he is searching for someone to permanently fill the position, Collins has asked Eric Green to serve as acting associate director. Since 2009, Green has served as director of National Human Genome Research Institute. He will continue in that role while serving as acting associate director.

NIH Releases First Grants to Break Down 'Big Data'

Aiming to uncover scientific insights that could be gleaned from analyzing increasingly complex biomedical data sets, the National Institutes of Health Thursday announced the first grants in a $656 million effort through 2020 to strengthen the capacity of researchers to use "big data."
The $32 million will be used to establish 12 centers that each will tackle specific data challenges.
The money will aid in the development of software and help train a data science workforce. Recipients include the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Wisconsin, Stanford University and the University of California Santa Cruz. 
A key objective is to be able to work easily across multiple data sets in trying to answer scientific questions, NIH Director Francis Collins said during a briefing. 
The hope is that investigators will be able to mine large amounts of data to improve the ability to predict who is at increased risk of developing breast cancer and heart attack, for example, and to speed discoveries to better prevent or treat those conditions.
"Data creation has become exponentially more rapid," said Collins. Fueling it are such things as the mapping of the genes that make up the human body, medical imaging projects and large epidemiological studies.
In 1990, data managed by the NIH National Center for Biotechnology Information fit on three floppy disks, said Philip Bourne, who was recently appointed as NIH associate director for data science,
In 2014, it could fill 400 million filing cabinets with four drawers apiece, he said. 
"More and more the NIH is sort of a digital enterprise," Bourne said. 
But there are many problems involved in trying to use all the new information. Among them are difficulties locating it and a lack of standards for organizing and analyzing the information. 
"A lack of standards and an unwillingness to make data available to colleagues hampers efforts to make data fully useful to the broad research community," NIH said in a press release announcing the grants. "Regardless of their research facilities, many scientists have not been trained in the computational skills to access and analyze large data sets."  
Collins said that "the potential of these data when used effectively can be quite astounding but we need to make sure that we have the right pieces in place to make that come true," said Collins.
