Digital-native agency closerlook inc. in Chicago has expanded its data science division and hired Monika Klimek to manage the unit as vice president of data science. Klimek will lead her team to engineer transformative experiences and deliver brand growth. 
"As our clients shift to digital-first strategies, more of them are placing a significant focus on using data and analyses to create personalized, cross-channel experiences that are relevant and engaging," said Steve Tulk, chief technology officer. "Monika's expertise in transforming data from campaigns and third-party sources into valuable insights will be critical as our clients seek to maximize impact and accelerate growth. Several of our client brands are already benefiting from her knowledge." The newly expanded data science division applies the latest technologies, such as smart tagging, data enrichment and predictive algorithms, to build brand-supported tactics that can be utilized across all channels and maximize ROI. All members of the data science team are trained on General Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR) compliance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. "My goal is to amplify innovation at every level of the brand experience at closerlook," said Klimek. "Our team is tasked with creating unique data solutions and software products driven by advanced methodologies such as machine learning and AI.

Is data science tech's ‘sexiest job'? Talent wars say so Murray Webb had been a lackluster student more interested in sports than schoolwork while attending a small Virginia college. Then he transferred to Kennesaw State University in suburban Atlanta to pursue a master's degree in applied statistics and landed four job offers upon graduation. Webb, 33, now earns $160,000 a year targeting health care customers for hospitals and says he is approached weekly by companies and recruiters seeking data scientists. 
Webb is part of a national employment trend that has data scientists at tech companies such as Airbnb and Uber adding the words "I'm hiring" next to their LinkedIn.com profiles. "The word on the street is there's definitely a shortage of people who can do data science," said Daniel Gutierrez, managing editor of the journal insideBIGDATA in Los Angeles. "A lot of people are transitioning from other fields like economics, psychology, mathematics, because they see the field is exploding and there's money to be made." Indeed, it turns out that even in the wake of Facebook's privacy scandal and other big-data blunders, finding people who can turn social-media clicks and user-posted photos into monetizable binary code is among the biggest challenges facing U.S. industry. People with data science bona fides are among the most sought-after professionals in business, with some data science Ph. Ds commanding as much as $300,000 or more from consulting firms. "I like to say we're seeing the employment equivalent of a run on the bank, and it's because everyone's chasing the same talent at the same time," said Jennifer Priestley, a professor of statistics and data science at Kennesaw State University. Job postings for data scientists rose 75 percent from January 2015 to January 2018 at Indeed.com, while job searches for data scientist roles rose 65 percent. A growing specialty is "sentiment analysis," or finding a way to quantify how many tweets are trashing your company or praising it. A typical data scientist job pays about $119,000 at the midpoint of salaries and rises to $168,000 at the 95th percentile, according to staffing agency Robert Half Technology. Andrew Gardner, a senior machine learning manager in Atlanta at IT security firm Symantec, fields at least one "serious inquiry" weekly from recruiters trying to hire him away even as he's trying to fill roles at Symantec. To compete for talent, Gardner is offering more perks including the ability to telecommute: "You have to compete a little differently." Aspirants like Jiong Gao, who is pursuing a master's in data science and analytics at Georgia State University, are rushing to get in while the getting's good. "It's the sexiest job in the 21st century," said a grinning Gao, 25, referencing the title of a 2012 Harvard Business Review article. "For everyone who has a background in computers, statistics and mathematics, it's the hottest job." Companies are begging colleges to let them help with class projects, hoping to get a foot in the door with future data scientists. Atlanta-based Equifax Inc. was one of 11 companies doing data science and prescriptive analytics projects with Cornell University this year, with Equifax offering up voluminous data sets scrubbed of personally identifiable information. The official goal was to determine how customers prioritized paying bills, such as whether someone is more prone to paying a mortgage, car or cell phone bill first, said Chris Yasko, who heads a data science research unit at Equifax. The unstated goal was making a connection with future graduates. "Honey, we have a backlog of companies that want to bring their data into our classroom," said Priestley. "I probably have a conversation with a company every week that wants to do that." Equifax is shortening the hiring process to keep anyone from slipping away. A data science candidate interviewed on a Friday had an offer in hand by the following Monday, said Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global analytics. The company hasn't seen a drop-off in candidate interest despite suffering a data breach that exposed some 146 million people's personal information, the company said. Experts in data science describe a wild West atmosphere right now, with little agreement over how to define the field and scores of people rushing to add "scientist" to their resumes whether or not it's accurate. A common definition calls data science a meshing of statistics, math and computer science, with practitioners using the Python and R programming languages to create algorithms for things like "recommendation engines" — those programs that predict what you may want to buy next based on your recent searches. "It used to be that if you were a mathematician you became a teacher, and then you became a geologist because your knowledge helped find oil, and then you went over to Wall Street," said Jim Sterne, chairman of the Digital Analytics Association. "And now, the quote is, the best minds of our generation are being put to work in advertising."

Judson University's Division of Professional Studies, in partnership with Decision Support Sciences, announced the launch of the nation's first fully applied data science boot camp targeted to corporate education. "The Judson Data Science Bootcamp has a number of critical differentiators," said James A. Libby, CEO of Decision Support Sciences. "We actually went out and asked Fortune 500 and Fortune 2000 firms what they wanted most in a boot camp, and then we built those criteria into the our boot camp." 
Libby said that the JUDS Bootcamp is the first fully applied boot camp that teaches the details of data science by solving real-world corporate problems. The JUDS boot camp is the first nationwide to have simultaneous parallel paths for business professionals, coders, and math/stats professionals, he notes. In another national distinctive, from its inception the boot camp has reserved up to 30 percent of its seats for historically underrepresented populations in STEM disciplines. All students will learn thought-leading content from a team of Ph.D./Educator/Practitioner/Mentors, who collectively have deployed data science-based engagements in 40-plus countries for more than 20 Fortune 500 firms. "Another unique aspect of the JUDS Data Science Bootcamp is that it will allow participants to attend whatever two-week module they desire, from Innovation to Predictive Analytics to Data Visualization to the Data Ecosystem," said Judson University President Gene Crume of the new program offering. "In that sense, it is actually a boot camp of boot camps." The first two cohorts of the JUDS Bootcamp are enrolling participants now. It will launch Sept. 4 and Jan. 8, 2020, at Judson's Elgin campus. Each module of the boot camp, except for the introductory one-week module, is two weeks long and includes 15 hours of hands-on classroom experience with the leading software and platforms in the industry. Professional fees for each module are $2,500, with access to an on-site, advanced laptop provided in the fee structure. "Judson is excited to partner with Decision Support Sciences to offer this new and innovative corporate education program," Crume said. "The JUDS Bootcamp has been created to meet the needs of businesses and industry leaders who need employees that are equipped to make the best data-driven decisions in today's fast-paced and changing environment." Further information regarding the JUDS Bootcamp can be obtained by emailing the bootcamp's enrollment team at juds.bootcamp@judsonu.edu

COD offers foundations of data science certificate
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set.
Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
For more information about the Foundations of Data Science certificate, visit www.cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.

The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set.
Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining.
"The data scientist has been described as the sexiest job of the 21st century," said Christine Monnier, Professor of Sociology at College of DuPage. "We are awash in a world of data. We now have the power to run massive computations on computers, resulting in more information than ever before. We live in a brand new world with facts at our fingertips, and anything we do now generates data. But do we know what to do with it?"
Monnier said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. A new course, "Introduction to Data Sciences," covers the breadth of the field, while the rest of the curriculum addresses research.
"In ‘Introduction to Research Methods,' students learn that while data can be found anywhere, you must learn how to collect good data," she said. "Students learn statistics in ‘Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences,' and then they either take ‘Introduction to Anthropological Methods,' an anthropology course that focuses on fieldwork, or ‘Introduction to Behavioral Research,' a psychology course that focuses on experimental practices."
Monnier said that most existing certificates in this field are very specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on the technical aspects of data processing.
"We wanted our certificate to be accessible to a broader population," she said. "People who are interested but new to the field can pursue the Foundations of Data Science certificate, and you don't need a background in computer science. You can even take several of the courses to fulfill general education requirements.
"Data analysis skills and research are the ultimate portable skills that have a wide range of applications and are sought after in multiple fields, such as marketing, public health, criminal justice and public policy. President Barak Obama is the first ever president to appoint a U.S. Chief of Data Scientist in his administration. It's a really hot field."
College of DuPage is an accredited community college that serves more than 29,000 students each term. The College, which grants nine associate degrees and more than 170 certificates in 100 areas of study, is the second largest provider of public undergraduate education in Illinois.

Startup makes data science a sport

SAN FRANCISCO — Strange secrets hide in numbers. For instance, an orange used car is least likely to be a lemon.
This particular unexpected finding came to light courtesy of a data jockey who goes by the Internet alias SirGuessalot, who in fact wasn't guessing at all. Instead, he and his partner, PlanetThanet, relied on the hard math skills that make them top contenders in a sport tailor-made for the 21st century: competitive number-crunching.
The used car defect prediction contest is one of dozens hosted by San Francisco online startup Kaggle, whose creators believe they can tap the global geek population's instinct for one-upmanship to mine better answers faster from the world's ever-rising mountain of data.
"Competitions bring together a wide variety of people into a wide variety of problems," said Jeremy Howard, who became Kaggle's president and chief scientist after winning multiple competitions himself. "You get people looking at stuff they'd never look at otherwise."
While the used car contest was fun, Kaggle has its eye on weightier scientific problems. In one contest, an English major who trained himself in data science built a model for predicting the progress of HIV infections in individual patients. In another, a scientist who studies glaciers for a living won a NASA-backed Kaggle competition to measure the shapes of galaxies by mapping the universe's dark matter.
The data problems that need solving are so important that those who find the solutions should be paid like professional athletes, said Kaggle founder Anthony Goldbloom. By turning data-mining into a crowdsourced contest, he hopes he's created a way to make that happen. Already one of Kaggle's contests offers a multimillion dollar prize.
"We want to see the best data scientists earning more than Tiger Woods," said Goldbloom, who started the company in his native Australia and recently came to San Francisco's South of Market startup haven.
The job market for mathematicians and statisticians has become hot as the sheer volume of data generated by ever faster, cheaper computing resources explodes.
Data storage has become so inexpensive that a 2011 McKinsey and Co. report estimated that a disk drive capable of storing all the world's music would cost about $600. Walmart stores 10 times more data on customer transactions and other parts of its operation than is contained in the entire Library of Congress, according to the same report.
Analyzing the so-called "big data" deluge has become a key task for businesses in an effort to divine everything from which ads online customers will click to how much inventory they need to maintain. Political candidates analyze data to predict voting patterns. Dating websites try to predict ideal mates.
Kaggle competitions focus on creating and testing formulas that can be used to make predictions based on the contents of giant data sets.
The more accurate the formula, the better the chances it will accurately provide answers to complex questions, such as the orange used car.
Goldbloom argues that no matter how many data scientists companies hire, relying on in-house data talent means companies can't know if they're getting the best solution.
In a Kaggle contest, competitors find out as soon as they submit their solutions how they stack up against fellow contestants. They can keep trying for the duration of the typically three-month contests, which are highlighted on the company website.
As the first entries come in, the accuracy of competing models improves by leaps, Goldbloom said. As the contests progress, the improvement curve flattens out. Goldbloom and Howard believe that shows the competitive approach pushes data scientists toward the best solutions within human reach.
"Crowdsourcing allows you to squeeze data dry," Goldbloom said.
Not all competitions are open to all comers, however. About 33,000 contestants have taken part in Kaggle's public competitions, where prize money tends to top out at around $10,000. Winners can get invited to participate in elite private contests, which may include access to sensitive private data sets.
Kaggle's business model depends on deep-pocketed contest sponsors like banks seeking to outdo each other with more lucrative prize purses to attract the best competitors, who themselves in theory could then make their livings off Kaggle competitions alone.
The biggest prize by far open to the public is $3 million offered by the California-based Heritage Provider Network medical group to the data scientist best able to use hospital admission records to predict the profiles of people most likely to end up in the hospital. The next-biggest purse is $100,000 in prizes put up by the Hewlett Foundation for algorithms that can automatically grade student essays.
In its grandest vision of itself, the 11-person company backed by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin will have tens of thousands of competitions running simultaneously. Guilds of data gurus will band together to unleash software that enters competitions automatically. Kaggle becomes not just a way to push humans to perform at their best but to make machines themselves smarter as code-based contestants battle and "learn" from their mistakes.
In this way, Howard said, data competitions become steps along the development of artificial intelligence systems such as self-driving cars.
As for why orange used cars are most likely to be in good shape, the numbers did not hold the answer. One notion was that such a flashy color would only attract car fanatics who would be more likely to take care of their vehicles. That didn't pan out, however, since the least well-kept used cars turned out to be purple.

Oh, to have the talent to be published under a HarperCollins imprint while still in college. Glenbrook North graduate Christina Li, Class of 2017, had her middle-grade novel, "Clues to the Universe" (Quill Tree Books), published on Jan. 12. Her full-time pursuit is as a senior economics major, with a minor in data science, at Stanford University. "I've gotten wonderful responses from readers, from friends who have read it," Li said. 
"It's been really lovely. I've gotten really, really kind notes from people — from kids and parents." At 304 pages in hardcover, "Clues to the Universe" is written for students in third through seventh grade, from about 8 to 12 years old. It's a work of fiction set in 1980 that pairs young protagonists and science class partners Rosalind, or "Ro," and Benjamin, or "Benji," as they become unlikely friends. Each has a father who is absent — one due to death, the other to divorce. The young students face their grief, others' bullying, and work through their differences to find meaning and, yes, piece together clues to some of the biggest questions in the universe. As Li said, "It's about space, friendship and finding your own way in the world." Like Li, the character of Ro is Chinese American. "It was a really joyful experience to bring that experience to the page," said Li, who praised her agent, Jess Regal of Helm Literary Agency, for helping the novel see print. Written during summer breaks from school, Li wrote "Clues to the Universe" over two years before selling it in the summer of 2019. The young author said the seeds of her muse were planted long ago. Among the acknowledgments in "Clues to the Universe" is the Northbrook Public Library and "the infamous eighth grade Wood Oaks Science Fair crew." Li also sourced her own youth. "I was able to reach for that feeling of shyness I had when I was a kid," she said. She's currently working on another middle-grade book set in present-day San Francisco. Though the premise is different, Li said, the story is similar: "figuring out the world around you and growing up and dealing with all the changes." Her vantage point is unique. "There weren't a lot of books that had Asian American characters when I was growing up," Li said. "I think it's just wonderful that I get to write these books and sort of be able to contribute to children's literature in that way." ‘Revolution U' Melissa Novack, half of the Glencoe husband-and-wife team that in late 2020 launched Revolution U — a subscription-based company offering on-demand fitness classes, a healthy habits program, support groups and one-on-one coaching — has written an accompanying book. "Revolution U: change your habits, change your life" guides readers through a series of exercises designed to replace bad habits with beneficial thoughts and behaviors to create a more meaningful life. The 204-page softcover book includes a daily planner in which readers can put this knowledge into action and create their own accountability plan. Novack is a licensed clinical social worker, registered yoga teacher and also a co-founder of True Mind &amp; Body wellness center in Northbrook. Her husband and Revolution U partner Matt Friedman is an Athletics and Fitness Association of America instructor and a certified indoor cycling instructor — in addition to being an attorney. "Revolution U" is available through Amazon and on the Revolution U website, joinrevolutionu.com.

Five candidates are vying for four, 4-year seats on the Roselle Elementary District 12 school board in the April 6, 2021 election. They are incumbents James J. McGowan, Kimberly Duris, Christopher B. Humbert, and Steven Zurek, and newcomer David Franzen. They responded to a Daily Herald questionnaire seeking their thoughts on some of the most pressing issues facing the district. Below are McGowan's responses. In-person early voting with paper ballots begins Feb. 25 at DuPage County Fairgrounds Building 5, 2015 Manchester Road, Wheaton. In-person early voting with touch-screen voting begins March 22 at locations throughout the county. Learn more at www.dupageco.org/earlyvoting/. No candidate is slated to run for the unexpired 2-year term. 
Five candidates for four, 4-year terms Bio City: Roselle Age: 49 Occupation: Finance director at Ingredion Civic involvement: Appointed to Roselle Elementary District 12 board in May 2019, and board vice president (2020 to present); youth volunteer, coach Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I am seeking reelection to the District 12 school board to continue driving this district toward achievement of its stated mission and strategic objectives. It is imperative to continue to capitalize on the momentum created over the past few years as well as leverage continuity and experience of working through the challenges of a pandemic. As a finance professional for more than 25 years, I have a keen interest in maintaining the financial health of District 12. My current roles of vice president and finance committee member at District 12 Board of Education provide an avenue to apply my financial expertise in decision-making processes regarding fiscal matters. This has been especially important in dealing with the pandemic impacts over this school year and will be moving forward, given the state of Illinois' budgetary issues. In addition to financial stewardship of community funding, the district has an exciting agenda made up of curriculum expansion and facility upgrades in support of District 12's mission of keeping students and their academic pursuits at the center of all decisions. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: District 12 school board has had a favorable response to the pandemic. The student population was converted to a full remote learning program in less than two weeks last spring as the pandemic hit our community. Next, a planning committee inclusive of our superintendent, both principals, social workers, nurses and teacher representatives was created to adequately plan a path to in-person learning in August 2020. Guided by data, science and advisement of local health organizations rigorous safety and sanitization protocols were established to protect students, families, teachers and support staff. Throughout the summer, in partnership with the district administration, teachers and families considered many learning models and ultimately a five-day dedicated in-person and a five-day dedicated remote instruction model were offered to keep student progression moving forward. As the year began, teacher devices were upgraded to meet the higher demands of remote learning. District 12 continues to offer both learning models today and through these careful considerations and decisions, we feel the learning loss of students has been minimized. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: The pandemic has clearly impacted district families, students and teachers in a variety of ways. The board, as well as the district administration, provided opportunities for community engagement and feedback regarding the overall response to pandemic impacts. All have been focused on an attempt to establish flexibility with learning models keeping the student's safety and academic progress at the forefront. I view my specific role as listening to members of the community, understanding their perspectives and taking them into account when engaging with my fellow board members to stay true to the district's mission for students as well as the safety protocols in accordance with health experts guidance. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe District 12 did continue to adequately serve students throughout the pandemic. This was accomplished via the in-person and remote learning models to address different family situations across both schools. Further, as more students expressed interest in transitioning to in-person learning in second term, alternative spacing decisions were made along with staffing adjustments. Each family in the district was ultimately able to receive their first choice in learning model for both the fall 2020 and spring 2021 term. Q: Do you have a plan on how to safely and effectively conduct classes in the spring? What have you learned from the fall semester that you would change in the spring? A: District 12 will continue to offer an in-person model and remote model to address different family desires for student learning this spring. The success of the fall term has resulted in more students moving to in-person learning and the district has been able to accommodate through creative problem-solving regarding space. I believe one of the most important learnings for our district is the benefit of increased engagement from District 12's families. Listening to their ideas, opinions and suggestions has assisted in setting a path to academic progress for students while keeping their health and safety prioritized. Q: What is your position on allowing high school sports to continue during the pandemic? Be specific. A: In accordance with health experts' recommendations, I am supportive of high school sports continuing during the pandemic. Strict adherence to mask wearing, social distancing, and other safety protocols must be followed as laid out by health officials, but I have seen the health and wellness benefits for kids safely participating in athletics during this difficult time.

Bio City: Roselle Age: 49 Occupation: Finance director at Ingredion Civic involvement: Appointed to Roselle Elementary District 12 board in May 2019, and board vice president (2020 to present); youth volunteer, coach Q&amp;A Q: Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you, and if so, what is it? A: I am seeking reelection to the District 12 school board to continue driving this district toward achievement of its stated mission and strategic objectives. It is imperative to continue to capitalize on the momentum created over the past few years as well as leverage continuity and experience of working through the challenges of a pandemic. 
As a finance professional for more than 25 years, I have a keen interest in maintaining the financial health of District 12. My current roles of vice president and finance committee member at District 12 Board of Education provide an avenue to apply my financial expertise in decision-making processes regarding fiscal matters. This has been especially important in dealing with the pandemic impacts over this school year and will be moving forward, given the state of Illinois' budgetary issues. In addition to financial stewardship of community funding, the district has an exciting agenda made up of curriculum expansion and facility upgrades in support of District 12's mission of keeping students and their academic pursuits at the center of all decisions. Q: How would you grade the current school board on its response to the pandemic? Why? A: District 12 school board has had a favorable response to the pandemic. The student population was converted to a full remote learning program in less than two weeks last spring as the pandemic hit our community. Next, a planning committee inclusive of our superintendent, both principals, social workers, nurses and teacher representatives was created to adequately plan a path to in-person learning in August 2020. Guided by data, science and advisement of local health organizations rigorous safety and sanitization protocols were established to protect students, families, teachers and support staff. Throughout the summer, in partnership with the district administration, teachers and families considered many learning models and ultimately a five-day dedicated in-person and a five-day dedicated remote instruction model were offered to keep student progression moving forward. As the year began, teacher devices were upgraded to meet the higher demands of remote learning. District 12 continues to offer both learning models today and through these careful considerations and decisions, we feel the learning loss of students has been minimized. Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state authorities? A: The pandemic has clearly impacted district families, students and teachers in a variety of ways. The board, as well as the district administration, provided opportunities for community engagement and feedback regarding the overall response to pandemic impacts. All have been focused on an attempt to establish flexibility with learning models keeping the student's safety and academic progress at the forefront. I view my specific role as listening to members of the community, understanding their perspectives and taking them into account when engaging with my fellow board members to stay true to the district's mission for students as well as the safety protocols in accordance with health experts guidance. Q: Did your district continue to adequately serve students during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to continue providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better. A: I believe District 12 did continue to adequately serve students throughout the pandemic.

Titan seniors anxious to start

BLOOMINGTON — Illinois Wesleyan basketball coach Ron Rose was “transparent” in discussing the options the Titans’ seniors faced entering the delayed and still somewhat uncertain season, according to Doug Wallen. 
And while the NCAA has opened the door for all Division III athletes to exercise another year of eligibility in 2021-22, the response was the same from IWU’s fourth-year players. 
“This is my last season,” said Wallen. 
“I’m done,” Charlie Bair said. “Hanging it up.” 
“This is definitely my last year,” said Colin Cheaney. 
The financial realities of playing at a non-scholarship level coupled with plans for graduation and a career mean Wallen, Bair and Cheaney have long ago confronted the fact the 2020-21 season would be their last in IWU uniforms whether COVID-19 allowed or canceled the scheduled games. 
“That was definitely a thought going through everybody’s head whether we would play or not,” said Cheaney, a math and data science major. “We’re fortunate to have the opportunity to play as many games as we can. Fingers crossed everybody follows the guidelines, and we’ll be able to play all the games.” 
IWU typically begins a 25-game regular season in early- to mid-November. Pandemic concerns led to the delay of a season that is now scheduled to begin Saturday at Carroll and consist of 12 games against only College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin opponents. 
“It’s obviously taken a crazy turn the past few months, but the whole team has been pretty consistent with long-term goals and the capabilities of our team,” Wallen said. “It’s nice to see everybody putting in the work both on campus and in our time at home. We’re excited to have the opportunity to play.” 
Wallen and Bair have been selected co-captains. 
“It took me a while to realize we might have the opportunity to play,” said Bair, a 6-foot-7 forward from Glenbard South High School who is majoring in finance. “I was trying to be optimistic, but I didn’t really see it happening with everything going on in Division I. Now we’re here and ready to go.” 
Wallen, Bair, Cheaney and Grant Wolfe are the elder statesmen on a team that finished 19-9 last season and returns every player who started a game in 2019-20 with the exception of Wolfe. 
The senior from Effingham was limited to seven games his junior year because of multiple concussions and will not play in the coming season for the same reason. 
Wolfe will remain associated with the team, lending his experience to sophomore Luke Yoder and the other Titans’ guards. 
“They were all able to watch him in fall practices and see why we all respect him so much,” Bair said. “All four of us planned to play all four years together. It’s tough seeing him have to hang it up, but it’s the right move.” 
“We have so much loyalty to Grant because he’s done so much for our program,” said Wallen, a marketing major. “He wants to be out there with us. It’s a tough time. We’re going to play for him and see what we can do.” 
Wesleyan coach Ron Rose is cautiously optimistic he will coach his seniors for one more season. 
“You feel for all the athletes at all levels who are losing a season and losing an opportunity to be part of a team. But my heart really went out to the seniors,” said Rose. “This is their last opportunity to be part of something that has been a big part of their lives. 
“We have four seniors, including Grant. These guys have meant a lot to our program. All of them are hard workers, outstanding students and love being part of the program. Through the entire process, I held onto hope those guys would get to wear the Titan jersey again and get to compete together. There’s still nothing guaranteed, but it’s exciting to have a plan in place to get to do that.” 
Even without Wolfe, the Titans are deep and talented throughout. Reigning CCIW Freshman of the Year Yoder (10.4 points per game last season) will be joined in the backcourt by Peter Lambesis (12.3), Keondre Schumacher (12.0), Cory Noe (8.8) and Cheaney. 
Wallen, a 6-5 guard/forward from Champaign, averaged 11.2 points and 5.6 rebounds and can play outside or inside. Handling the bulk of the inside work will be Bair (9.0, 8.3). Matt Leritz (10.9, 5.5) and Cody Mitchell. 
“I’m pretty sure we practiced more than anybody in the conference with those seven weeks we had in the fall,” Bair said. “Couple that with basically having the same team we had last year, we’re all on the same page all the time. That’s kind of our strength right now, being one unit.” 
The 6-4 Cheaney emerged as a key reserve last season as a junior. 
“This whole group has a great work ethic. We continued to work the whole offseason pushing ourselves to make ourselves better,” said the Batavia native. “This team has a lot of potential. I think it’s going to be a special year for us.”

Illinois aims to boost flagging tech economy with public- private research network

UI says development key to fighting brain drain, racial disparities in private sector SPRINGFIELD — University of Illinois faculty say an ongoing statewide investment in a public-private research network is key to boosting the state's economy. The Discovery Partners Institute, a UI-led research and workforce development hub based in Chicago, is the flagship program of the Illinois Innovation Network that seeks to invest in 15 regional hubs affiliated with the UI system to spur economic growth with state funding. The goal of IIN is to create technology jobs in Illinois and train the state's workforce to fill them. UI representatives testified before the state Senate Higher Education Committee during a subject matter hearing on Monday, claiming that despite Illinois' success in business and STEM education, the state hasn't seen the economic boon to match its academic output. 
"So, broadly, the great thing about Illinois is it is a place where talent gets created, it has tremendous capabilities in creating tech talent," DPI Director Bill Jackson said in his testimony. According to UI's presentation, Illinois is second nationally in computer science graduates and food research and development, fourth in MBA graduates, and fifth in data science graduates. But this hasn't translated to the private sector, leading to a "brain drain" of Illinois-educated tech workers, he said. "But, our issue, right, is we lose that talent," Jackson said. "It goes to the coast, it goes other places and it doesn't stay within the state. We do all the development and we don't get the essence of all that great capability we're building." Illinois is 31st in state economic growth, 46th in private job growth, and 62 percent of computer science graduates leave the state after receiving their degree, according to the university's representatives. On top of that, half of all startups that raise more than $5 million relocate. The UI's tech programs are also not racially equitable. In Chicago, Black residents and Latino residents each make up around 30 percent of the city's population. Cumulatively, they make up 12 percent of Chicago's tech workforce, despite accounting for 60 percent of the general population. In 2019, less than 2 percent of UI system computer and data science graduates were Black, while 5 percent were Latino. The UI representatives contended that this disparity limits the workforce that can be developed to address personnel shortfalls in the tech industry and keeps Illinois behind other states like California and Washington, which have seen similar levels of academic success as Illinois but have reaped larger growth in the private sector. The solution, according to UI's presentation, is continued investment in computer science classes and computer science teachers in public schools zoned for underserved communities. They also promote programs that target Black and Latino K-12 students to establish a pipeline for earning computer and data science degrees at Illinois universities. DPI's Chicago campus, in a development area called The 78, is scheduled to be completed by 2025. Most of the other hubs are situated on public university campuses and in existing structures and are scheduled to be operational over the next few years. Hubs will have an established focus based on their region and the university that houses them. Focus areas include computing and data, food and agriculture, entrepreneurship and environment, and water. An economic impact statement crafted by the Boston Consulting Group in late 2019 claims DPI and IIN will generate $198 billion in economic activity and create or fill 48,000 jobs over the next 10 years. The study says that by the 2029 fiscal year, the project will create or fill more than 9,500 jobs annually, with 4,500 of those going to individuals from underserved backgrounds. State Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, who represents the Champaign area including UI's flagship campus, pressed UI system witnesses on how effective their project would really be in cultivating tech talent in the state. Rose cited a Wall Street Journal article discussing how the world's largest tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are creating 6-month vocational programs that are meant to serve as a competing and equal credential to a 4-year degree. "It seems to me the private marketplace is now going to cannibalize our students," Rose said. "What is this space that DPI is trying to capture where it is a market leader that is not already captured by someone else, not captured by Austin, not captured by Silicon Valley, not captured by Boston or by North Carolina?" Jackson said that while Google and other big tech corporations are filling one gap in the marketplace, DPI will create the capacity for more tech jobs in the state. He also said that its different hubs and focus on creating pipelines in K-12 education allow it to fill multiple market gaps outside of just data science. According to Jackson, Illinois institutions are uniquely situated for developing digital agriculture, transportation logistics and medical research. Rose said he was pleased with the idea of DPI and IIN for boosting Illinois' economy through the technology sector, but he cautioned the state "not to create a wheel that's already been created somewhere else." DPI and IIN were originally approved under former Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017 but had funding delayed over the course of his term. The state released $500 million in state funds for DPI and IIN in February, with another $501 million in nonstate funds being committed to both projects. At the senate committee on Monday, UI system representatives said half of the state funds will go to DPI and the other half to the 14 other hubs in the network. According to UI representatives, only a portion of that money has been distributed for the planning and construction of DPI and five other hubs so far. Those hubs include Eastern Illinois University, Governors State University, Chicago State University, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. * Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government and distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide. It is funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.

Crain's annual list brings you the headliners, behind-the-scenes heroes, new faces and emerging stars of Chicago tech you need to know now. They're the CEOs, entrepreneurs, technologists, dealmakers, researchers and support players who make things go.
NANCY AMATO, 55 Head of computer science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Amato returned in January to U of I, where she earned her doctorate almost 25 years ago. Nostalgia aside, the appeal of running a top five program was too much to pass up, so she left Texas A&M and headed north. Two areas of research interest are robotics and artificial intelligence, which are top draws for students and faculty U of I wants to attract. "We have at least as much going on in those areas as Carnegie Mellon," Amato says. "It's just not packaged as well."
Who knew? She really wanted to be an archaeologist but studied math and economics instead.
DAVID AWSCHALOM, 62 Professor, director of Chicago Quantum Exchange University of Chicago
The next big thing in computing is actually quite small: quantum computing. It's the idea of creating and transmitting data at the atomic level using the laws of quantum physics. It's a totally different approach to computing. Awschalom, a former researcher at IBM's Watson Research Center, is leading the Chicago Quantum Exchange at U of C, which is one of a handful of research facilities focused on quantum computing.
Who knew? He built houses and harpsichords while studying physics and computer engineering in college.
JEREMIE BACON, 44 CEO, Imagineer Technology Group Chairman, Illinois Technology Association
This serial software entrepreneur recently became chairman of the Illinois Technology Association. Bacon co-founded Backstop Solutions, which provided back-office software to hedge funds and other investment managers, in 2003. In 2015, Bacon co-founded Synap Software Labs, a relationship software company, which merged with Imagineer.
Who knew? He's a musical theater junkie and performer who appears in at least one show each year.
NAWAF BITAR, 54 Chief information officer Citadel Securities
Citadel Securities, the market-making sibling of Ken Griffin's hedge fund, handles 1 out of every 5 stock trades in the U.S. That much data requires a lot of computing capacity, bandwidth and tech talent. Overseeing it all is Bitar, who spent three decades in Silicon Valley. He honed his cloud skills at VMWare and his security chops at Juniper Networks.
Who knew? During football season, you can find him most Saturdays at Darryl Royal Stadium in Austin, Texas, cheering on the Texas Longhorns.
DANIELLE BROWN, 48 Chief information officer Brunswick
One of the toughest jobs in tech is catching up to new technology without falling behind elsewhere. Brown knows this slippery slope well. She came to Brunswick, the boating and marine equipment company in Lake Forest, after 16 years at DuPont, where she helped upgrade its internal technology. Since she arrived in 2016, Brunswick has migrated to the cloud, implemented extensive data analytics from manufacturing to sales and rolled out a connected-boat app for consumers.
Who knew? A techie by day and power-tool fanatic by night, "I'm not one for small fixes. Give me crown molding, drywall, tile and, yes, even minor electrical work."
KEITH CARLSON, 51 Chief technology officer Relativity
Carlson spent nearly a decade managing payments technology and fighting fraud with one of Amazon's fastest-growing businesses, its cloud-computing unit known as AWS, before taking over the top technology job at Relativity. He'll help the legal-software company, formerly called kCura, finish making the transition to the cloud. He'll also be leading one of the largest tech teams in Chicago.
Who knew? Carlson learned the most important engineering lessons while working in a barn on his uncle's farm in southern Indiana.
TERESA CAUVEL, 26 Co-founder, CTO Neopenda

She and Sona Shah, whom she met while studying biomedical engineering at Columbia University, started Neopenda in Chicago four years ago. The company is creating a wearable device that tracks the vital signs of newborns in developing countries. It's expected to be available late this year or in early 2020.
Who knew? She's an avid traveler and nomad who has lived in six states.
LIN CLASSON, 50 Head of public cloud product Ensono
Classon started quite a conversation with a photo outside a near-empty bathroom at a tech conference two years ago to highlight the continuing diversity deficit in the industry. She really put a spotlight on the problem when she convinced her employer, computer services firm Ensono, to survey female tech workers. They found 1 in 4 had experienced sexual harassment. Classon, who previously worked at Google, got into the software business 14 years ago, after stints at McKinsey and United.
Who knew? She has a doctorate in theater from Northwestern University and has played Hamlet, Lizzie Borden and Billy the Kid.
BEN COLLINS- SUSSMAN, 46 Engineering director Google
He was one of Google's first engineers in Chicago in 2005. Today, Collins-Sussman is the senior engineering manager for a team that's now more than 300 strong. He also leads a global team focused on latency, or the speed of Google's search engine. A math major from the University of Chicago, he's a longtime co-collaborator with fellow Chicago technologist Brian Fitzpatrick. They've written two books on coding.

His algorithms help ShopRunner's retailers tame unwieldy online product catalogs and make better-targeted recommendations to customers. D'Agostino developed a passion for machine learning while studying neutrinos at Argonne National Laboratory, which led him to Barack Obama's re-election campaign and later to online-payments software maker Braintree.
Who knew? He worked at the South Pole, taught physics at a boarding school in England and wrote about science for the Economist magazine.
MARCELO DE SANTIS, 50 Executive adviser ThoughtWorks
De Santis climbs mountains in his spare time, but his day job is scaling Big IT. He has been chief information officer at food maker Mondelez and tire maker Pirelli, where he oversaw a digital overhaul of the Italian company that was founded in 1872. He's also an active startup mentor at 1871.
Who knew? De Santis has tried to climb Mount Everest twice and plans a third attempt in March.
MIKE DUFFY, 41 Founder, CEO CityBase
To most people, government tech is an oxymoron. Not for Duffy, a former financial analyst at Northern Trust who took up the mission of bringing the convenience of e-commerce to City Hall, helping cities such as Indianapolis and San Francisco offer online payments. Unsexy for sure, but also lucrative. The company ground along for five years, moving at the speed of government, before it was acquired last year for $160 million. Duffy remains onboard as CEO.
Who knew? His hobby is making short films.
JENNY FARVER, 42 Chief technology officer Lightstream
Farver was teaching computer science before she took the leap into startups. She earned a doctorate in engineering from MIT, with a focus on transportation, algorithms and artificial intelligence. She built a team of more than 50 engineers at data-science startup Civis Analytics before taking the CTO job at Popular Pays, a talent marketplace for social media influencers. Now Farver is CTO at Lightstream, which makes live-streaming technology.
Who knew? Before joining Civis as a software engineer, she spent 3½ years as a stay-at-home mom.
MICHAEL FRANKLIN, 57 Chairman, computer science University of Chicago
One of the world's experts in cloud computing and handling massive amounts of data, Franklin was lured to Hyde Park from Berkeley three years ago by a big check with few strings attached and the chance to create a top computer science department. You have to admire anyone who helped create a piece of software called Badass, short for "Berkeley Data Analytics Stack." He also was behind Apache Spark, a widely used software platform for large-scale data processing.
Who knew? He's recently been to Tibet and Cambodia. Next up: Machu Picchu.
STEVEN GALANIS, 31 Co-founder, CEO Cameo
Galanis grew up around the glam of the entertainment business. He even produced a low-budget action TV show with actor Dolph Lundgren while working as a CBOE options trader. But he really cashed in on D-list stars like Lundgren when he and some friends created Cameo, a marketplace that allows people to pay celebrities and athletes to provide video shoutouts, taunts or other personalized messages for a fee. The idea went viral, but people really took notice when A-list Silicon Valley investor Kleiner Perkins led a $50 million investment.
Who knew? Galanis was a state champion hockey goalie and class president at Glenbrook South High School who sailed around the world while in college.
MOLLY GRATON (LEFT), 18, AND KYLA GURU, 17 Co-founders GirlCon
It's never too early to start tackling the gender divide in tech. Graton and Guru wanted to give other high school girls a chance to network and learn from professional women what science, technology, engineering and math careers look like.
The result was GirlCon, which attracts hundreds of girls each year for a day-long event. It started during a meeting at Starbucks between Graton and Guru. Within a few months, they spread the word about a conference in Chicago. It went viral, attracting more than 100 girls to Northwestern University. They signed up 50 mentors and raised $14,000, lining up sponsors such as Baxter International, IBM and Pinterest.
This year's follow-up effort attracted 300 girls to Google and included a keynote presentation by a CIA counterterrorism expert.
Graton is off to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Guru will be a senior at Deerfield High School. We can't wait to see what they do next.
Who knew? Graton taught herself to play the ukulele by watching YouTube.
Who knew? Guru won the district spelling bee five years in a row and memorized Webster's Third New International Dictionary.
RON GUERRIER, 44 Chief information officer State of Illinois

Why big data is a big deal; Corporate giants and startups are binge-hiring local data scientists
Crain's Chicago Business

John Akred knew just where to look when his Silicon Valley startup needed more data scientists-Chicago.
Though Silicon Valley Data Science has been based in Mountain View, Calif., since he co-founded the big data consultancy in 2013, there aren't enough data scientists to satisfy demand. So in November, Akred set up an outpost on Michigan Avenue, where it now has seven data scientists.
"It's about access to talent," says Akred, a Chicago native who had worked at CBOE Holdings and analytics firm SPSS before joining Accenture, which transferred him to Silicon Valley a few years ago. "I knew how deep the pool was here."
Demand for data scientists is skyrocketing as mainstream companies such as Caterpillar, General Electric and IBM get serious about harnessing the massive amount of information available from a rapidly growing pool of always-on sensors and computer networks. "We used to have lies, damn lies and statistics," says Dan Gaylin, CEO of NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent research organization, and one of the city's earliest data-science practitioners. "We're going to have lies, damn lies and big data."
Those who know the difference are rewarded with six-figure salaries. And Chicago is emerging as a data-science hub, which could provide its growing tech industry the heft in a high-profile sector that it never quite developed in software, semiconductors or the Internet.
Among homegrown startups focused on data science and analytics are Uptake, Civis Analytics, 4C Insights, KnowledgeHound, Networked Insights and Narrative Science. Dunnhumby, a London-based data consultant whose clients include Mondelez and Macy's, is here, too, with a 25- person data-science group in the Merchandise Mart. Andy Hill, Dunnhumby's head of U.S. headquarters, plans to more than double its headcount this year. "There's a real base of analytics talent here," he says.
They join a group of established players in consumer products, airlines, insurance, consulting, finance and markets. Even Microsoft has a data-science team here. "Chicago has two unique strengths: City government is a pioneer in open data, and it has a lot of non-tech companies that have tremendous analytics teams," says Shlomo Engelson Argamon, who heads the master's of data science program at Illinois Institute of Technology.
Other anchors include market researchers IRI and comScore and specialty consultancies such as Evanston-based ZS and Chicago-based Forum Analytics.
Data science is a small, specialized field that doesn't show up in labor statistics, and there is little hard data within the industry. But experts say Chicago is a top market behind only Silicon Valley and perhaps Seattle and New York. "The big companies are always hiring . . . and the high-growth companies, they're starting them here because of the talent," says Marybeth Haas, founder of Haas & Riley Executive Search in Chicago, which specializes in data-science recruiting.
Experienced data scientists can earn $120,000 a year or more, on par with pay for top software engineers or mobile developers.
Customers no doubt are a key draw for analytics companies. It was a big reason that Emnos, the analytics-consulting arm of American Express, set up shop in River North in 2011. The Munich-based company counts Deerfield-based Walgreens Boots Alliance among its clients. It has about 25 workers here, half of them data scientists.
"It's true the (San Francisco) Bay Area has more humans who do this," says Rob Lowe, CEO of Wellspring Worldwide, a research-analytics software firm in Chicago. But that's only part of the story, he says. "It's a better value to be in Chicago. The (salary) cost is at least 20 percent higher in California. People turn over jobs a lot more, and you have to plan on higher training costs."
Sheila Talton, founder of Gray Matter Analytics, a consulting firm of about 20 people, split between San Francisco and Chicago, says it took four months to hire two people in California. "It's extremely competitive," she says, noting that two clients recently hired people from Chicago for top jobs and moved them to California.
Local universities have responded to the increased demand by launching master's programs in data science and analytics. Among them are IIT, DePaul University, Northwestern University, University of Chicago and University of Illinois at Chicago. Diego Klabjan, director of the master's in analytics program at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, says applications in the past two years have soared by one-third to 800 for just 35 spots.
It's not just data-science programs that feed the need. Dan Wagner, CEO of Civis Analytics, which employs about 100 in the West Loop, routinely hires from U of C's economics and physics programs.
Being a geek never seemed so cool.

Before World War II in what is now the Czech Republic, Paul Hletko's grandfather's family owned a large brewery that was confiscated by the Nazis. The grandfather survived the Holocaust but wasn't able to recover the business. That inspired Hletko to start a micro/craft distillery in part to honor his family history.

The distillery produces bourbon, rye and single malt whiskey and gin. Revenue has grown to $2 million with a staff of six.

In 2018, she completed a $2.6 million roofing project on a milelong building at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital near Broadview.

She serves on the state's Business Enterprise Program Council.

Historically, small women-, minority- or veteran-owned investment firms were rarely used by large pension funds and endowments, Teska says.

On a wine tasting trip to Michigan in 2011, Bob Wilson wondered why it was so difficult to find artisanal wines on store shelves.

More than 110 wineries participate on the platform. Winestyr is funded through a mix of family and friends, angel investors and institutional capital. It has raised more than $6 million with investments from Chicago-based Continental Advisors and strategic investor Constellation Ventures. Revenue last year was $2.8 million, and the firm employs 11. With the closing of restaurants, wine shops and wine tasting rooms, Winestyr has provided a needed sales outlet for small wineries.
Robert Yoskowitz Co-founder and CEO Nullafi
Traditional cybersecurity involves scrambling to build higher and stronger walls to keep out increasingly sophisticated hackers. Robert Yoskowitz and his partners aim to refocus cybersecurity, removing the fallout of a breach, rather than failing to prevent one. They developed a proprietary masking technology that renders sensitive data useless to hackers but retains its integrity for authorized users. Nullafi initially was directed at consumers, but investors recommended refocusing the company as a software-as-a service B2B technology. It has eight full-time and six part-time employees.

These 25 up-and-comers are making a mark in Chicago-area technology. A number are entrepreneurs starting companies using technology to offer innovative products and services.
Some startups are finding niches in business-to-business software, whether for targeted industries such as law, insurance and construction or for broader application such as cybersecurity and online payments.
Many of the rising stars have specialties in software development, IT operations, cloud migration and data analytics needed to grow young companies but also to help larger and more established enterprises make better use of technology.
During the pandemic, their skills are in more demand than ever. They've helped firms transition their teams to remote work. And many are leading digital businesses that are surging, from e-commerce shipping to restaurant delivery. These stars are contributing to Chicago's profile as an emerging technology center.
METHODOLOGY: The rising stars featured did not pay to be included. Their profiles were drawn from nomination materials submitted. This list is not comprehensive. It includes only technical managers and executives for whom nominations were submitted and accepted after an editorial review. These honorees have less than 15 years in the profession and have demonstrated an impact at their company or in their field, with their work advancing Chicago as a tech hub. We asked for letters of recommendation, and excerpts are quoted in the profiles below.

"Ben has navigated his team through the COVID waters, and they are as strong as ever," says board member Nick Solaro, general partner at Drive Capital.

As the global pandemic reaches new heights across the United States, Americans are likely to be spending even more time at home this winter. With home shoppers already searching for more space in a housing market that has yet to slow down, last week Realtor.com revealed the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space near the nation's 10 largest metros. "These areas just outside of the urban centers of the largest metros offer homebuyers more space for the money. Potential buyers who've been dreaming of more space for work and play don't have to look far to save 29% per square foot on average or get 25%-65% more square footage for the same price as a home closer to downtown," said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. "For a 2,000-square-foot home, this could mean 500-1,300 additional square feet." 
In Illinois, one community made the website's Top Ten. Palos Hills, a Southwest suburb of Chicago, was listed at No. 3 with its median home listing price of $379,000 (single-family homes, 1,800 square feet or larger). That is a cost of $139 per square foot, 24% less per square foot to a comparable home in the city, Realtor.com said. Realtor.com identified the top suburbs that offer the most affordable space by analyzing list prices and median price per square foot for single-family homes within 25 miles of the nation's 10 largest metros. The biggest savings out of the 10 largest metros can be found in Fullerton, California, where homebuyers can find a 2,000-square-foot single family home for $304,000 less, on average, than in nearby Los Angeles. Also offering significant savings is Clark, New Jersey, right outside of New York City, where buyers can save almost a quarter of a million dollars, on average, on a 2,000-square foot home, or get an additional 1,025 square feet for the same budget compared to similar city homes. Palos Hills offers a dense suburban feel with most of its 17,195 residents owning their homes. An array of restaurants, coffee shops and parks — including Bennett Park, where they offer outdoor movies and fishing — make this town a draw for young professionals and retirees, the website says. The area is also home to many young families because of its top-rated school system, which includes Oak Ridge Elementary School — with a GreatSchools rating of 10 out of 10. For those looking for more space, here's where to head (ranked by median listing price): 1) Sicklerville, N.J. Urban Metro: Philadelphia Median Listing Price: $282,000 Savings Per Square Foot: 20% (Suburb: $118 / Urban: $148) Median Income: $89,300 A 30-minute drive southeast of Philadelphia, Sicklerville is a community located within Winslow Township in Camden County, N.J.

South Loop research center finally gets big check from Pritzker; Discovery Partners Institute receives $23.5 million, the first installment of state help needed for a project considered key to Chicago's growth as a tech center

After years of promises from two governors, the budding Discovery Partners Institute in the South Loop finally is getting the first installment of the state help needed for a project considered key to Chicago's growth as a tech center.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced that he has released $142 million for various university research projects, including $23.5 million for design of DPI's 500,000-square-foot headquarters in the 78 development at Roosevelt Road and the Chicago River.
An additional $98 million will go the University of Illinois at Chicago for a previously announced computer design research and learning center. The remainder is for university projects in Chicago and other parts of the state under the Illinois Innovation Network.
The DPI project is especially important to both the city's tech and real estate communities.
Pritzker had said earlier this year that he intended to release $500 million for DPI and other projects originally appropriated under former Gov. Bruce Rauner. But he had not done so, setting off speculation that the project was having trouble getting off the ground.
But on Nov. 18, Pritzker said the money now has been committed, and he also announced that consulting firm Jacobs and OMA-AMO, an architecture and design firm, have been selected to design and engineer the flagship structure.
"This investment will strengthen our state's long-term economic vitality for generations to come, creating and supporting nearly 50,000 new jobs in the next 10 years, with an economic impact of $19 billion," Pritzker said in a statement.
DPI is a unit of the University of Illinois. Other U of I projects are getting a piece of the $142 million, with $4.4 million for a UIC innovation center and $14 million to design a data science center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
DPI has been a particularly important project to U of I President Timothy Killeen, who has viewed it as a way to better connect companies in need of tech talent with university researchers and students. Pritzker had insisted the university match state funding with other contributions dollar for dollar. It wasn't immediately clear where that stands, but Pritzker's statement indicated the headquarters overall will cost $250 million, of which the state will invest $235 million.
DPI also is critical to the 78 developer Related Midwest, which has donated land for the institute facility and hopes it will anchor other business, retail and residential projects on the 62-acre site.
DPI hopes to have the South Loop facility open by fall 2025, according to a spokeswoman, and has signed a land-use agreement with Related Midwest.

2020'S HOT JOBS; The most in-demand jobs that pay at least $60,000
Crain's Chicago Business

What a difference a pandemic makes. When Crain's reported on in-demand jobs at the start of this year, the state unemployment rate was 3.5 percent. HR managers fretted about the labor shortage, and recruiters were a hot commodity.
COVID-19, of course, has turned the economy upside down, crippling travel, airlines, hotels, restaurants and theaters. Illinois unemployment stood at 14.6 percent in June, with employed workers fearful of layoffs and furloughs. Temporary or gig economy workers were sidelined.
"The pandemic hit some sectors like a bomb," says Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas. "It's a dark picture for white-collar workers. People feel like they're on the chopping block."
As in any downturn, there always are pockets of opportunity. The pandemic has drawn attention to critical roles such as respiratory therapists and lab technicians. Epidemiologists are expected to be in demand as governments aim to be better prepared for outbreaks of communicable disease.
As more business activity moves online, technologists are needed on platforms for telemedicine, virtual meetings and expanded e-commerce. There's demand for engineers who migrate an organization's data and applications to the cloud and then handle day-to-day troubleshooting. "I know the economy is in shambles right now, but it's a good time to be in tech," says Alex Brown, CEO of Chicago-based data-migration consultancy 10th Magnitude.
Home improvement and the furnishing sector are enjoying a renaissance as families hunker down in their homes and splurge on amenities such as hot tubs and pingpong tables.
As remote work becomes more accepted, employers are more open to hiring workers who are out of town. Before the pandemic, employers might have hired 5 to 10 percent remote workers, says Matt Massucci, founder and managing partner of Hirewell, a recruiting firm. Now they are comfortable having 40 to 50 percent of their workforce elsewhere.
The expansion of remote work levels the playing field for young workers starting their careers, says Raheela Gill Anwar, head of sales and client service at talent consultancy BPI Group. "In the past, if you were at a school that Bank of America didn't recruit at, you were out of luck," she says. "Now (no matter your school) you have a better chance of being considered."
Another plus: Good-paying jobs don't necessarily require a bachelor's degree. In many cases a two-year technical training program is sufficient. In health care, there are good-paying positions that many people are unaware of, says Betsy Rahill, director of talent strategy at UChicago Medicine. "You don't have to go to a four-year program."
Here are some of the most in-demand jobs that have median incomes of at least $60,000.
RESPIRATORY THERAPIST
These professionals have been heroes of the pandemic, assisting patients before, during and after they receive treatment on a ventilator. Health care professionals say this position will be important beyond COVID-19. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a growth rate of 21 percent through 2028, outpacing the average growth rate of 5 percent. Some work will be for the lingering effects of the illness, some for chronic diseases such as asthma, while other work will be preventive, says Betsy Rahill, director of talent strategy at UChicago Medicine. Therapists can work in a hospital, in a clinic or for a home-care provider. They must complete a two-year program and pass a licensing exam, but a four-year degree isn't required, Rahill says.
Pay: BLS pegs median pay at $61,330, while UChicago starts its therapists at $70,000 and pays an average of $74,000, Rahill says.
CLOUD OPERATIONS ENGINEER
This is the updated version of the IT guy who helped troubleshoot your frozen desktop. Once a system is migrated to the cloud, operational engineers are needed to fix the inevitable problems that arise. The job has a big customer service component because "you have to talk to customers," says Alex Brown, CEO of data-migration consultancy 10th Magnitude. But companies increasingly are outsourcing this role because it doesn't require specific knowledge of a company's business. "It's the fastest-growing part of our business," Brown adds. "Last month we hired 10 people for this role." A technical certificate can be sufficient training, and some veterans have benefited from the military's technical training program that prepares outgoing service members for civilian life.
Pay: The operations role pays a median of $60,000 to $65,000.
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIST & HISTOTECHNOLOGIST
Medical technologists play a critical role behind the scenes, testing body fluids and tissue for disease. The jobs range from the routine analysis of blood draws at clinics to analyzing surgical samples in specialized labs at academic medical centers. Job growth is projected at 11 percent through 2028, according to BLS.
Histotechnologists, who study the microscopic structure of body tissue and prepare samples for analysis, are in short supply in the Chicago area, says Betsy Rahill, director of talent strategy at UChicago Medicine. Lab technician jobs require a bachelor's degree, while histotechnologist positions require specialized training and certification, she says.
Pay: Average pay for medical technologists at UChicago is $67,000. Histotechnologist jobs pay in the mid-$60,000s to $70,000.
EPIDEMIOLOGIST
The pandemic has spotlighted these professionals who identify patterns of disease in populations and make recommendations. They also do the labor-intensive work of contact tracing. Even before COVID-19, epidemiologists have been in demand because there is more data to analyze, says Dr. Kiran Joshi, senior medical officer for the Cook County Department of Public Health. The department employs 29 epidemiologists, most for communicable diseases. The lessons of COVID could make government organizations more vigilant about identifying possible epidemics. But Joshi says more demand is likely to come from health care systems, universities and other private employers. Epidemiologists usually have a master's degree in public health.
Pay: BLS lists median pay at $70,990, although experienced professionals with master's degrees may earn more, Joshi says.
SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGER
The pandemic exposed weaknesses in global supply chains and put the spotlight on managers, who scrambled to source protective equipment and other goods that were in short supply. The job will be in demand beyond COVID-19 as a result of disruptions to trade and established supply lines, says Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas. The position is both art and science. Managers must have strong technical training since the logistics are handled on the web. Yet they also must be well connected and resourceful to track needed supplies when there are shortages. A bachelor's degree is typically required, but an associate degree may be sufficient for some jobs, according to BLS.
Pay: Median salary is $74,750, according to BLS, with rates varying by industry and experience.
MANAGER OF DIGITAL EXPERIENCE
These managers are responsible for developing and enhancing the experience of customers on an organization's website or mobile applications. Usually based in marketing with a mandate for expanding usage, they work with the technical team to ensure the portal is easy to navigate. One particularly hot area is telemedicine, which has taken off during the pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak accelerated interest in and development of virtual care, says Tara Nooteboom, digital patient experience manager at Rush University Medical Center, adding, "We are now where we thought we would be in four years." While the role is relatively new to health care, it is key to any company aiming to expand digital usage and website visits-from retailers to universities. A bachelor's degree with a grounding in user experience technology, marketing communications and/or business strategy is best.
Pay: Median salary is in the range of $80,000 to $85,000, say experts at Rush.
OPERATIONS RESEARCH ANALYST
These specialists use software, statistical analysis, modeling and other tools to get under the hood of processes to identify and troubleshoot problems. They often work at manufacturers-possibly monitoring the quality of components or efficiency of shippers delivering parts, says Nancy Darian, a recruiter for data science and analytics jobs at recruiter Smith Hanley Associates. But the work also could be applicable to running a bank's call center efficiently. How many customer service representatives are needed on a shift? Should staffing be boosted in anticipation of a surge in calls? Like data scientists, these analysts often have master's degrees with expertise in mathematical modeling.
Pay: The government pegs the median salary at $84,810. Analysts might typically start at $70,000 or more and progress to six figures in senior or managerial roles.
DATA SCIENTIST
These professionals make sense of big, sometimes enormous, datasets. Using software tools, they build algorithms and models to spot and solve business problems. Data scientists draw conclusions and make recommendations to management such as a change in suppliers or shippers or a technology upgrade, says Kanak Rajan, a partner at HR consultancy Mercer in Chicago. They often monitor data that's streamed over the internet. For example, a sensor in a tractor engine relays information on performance so that a manufacturer could forestall a problem by shipping a new part, says Nancy Darian, a recruiter for data science and analytics jobs at recruiter Smith Hanley Associates. Data specialists typically have a master's degree, with expertise in mathematical modeling or business intelligence.
Pay: Data scientists can start as an analyst, with a median salary of $87,780, according to BLS. The government says the median salary for statisticians and mathematicians is at $92,030, but salaries often run over $100,000, recruiters say.
CLOUD INTEGRATION ENGINEER
These specialized engineers handle the process of migrating a company's data and applications to the cloud. They design the infrastructure and handle the deployment and coding, making the work project-based. During the pandemic, companies are accelerating migration so that work can be handled remotely, says Alex Brown, CEO of data-migration consultancy 10th Magnitude. These engineers must be proficient in at least one of the three cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. They can work for a big data-migration consultancy like 10th Magnitude or be full time at a large or tech-centric company where their knowledge of the business is important, Brown says. This role usually requires a bachelor's degree, typically in computer science, and three to five years of experience.
Pay: These engineers earn between $80,000 to $120,000, depending on experience.
E-COMMERCE MANAGER
The pandemic accelerated online shopping as consumers sheltered and took to their phones and laptops to order groceries, household items, clothes and gifts. That's elevated the role of specialists in e-commerce, says Tom Gimbel, CEO of staffing agency LaSalle Network. E-commerce specialists use data to identify trends. They recommend which consumers to target, which products to feature and which to discontinue. E-commerce specialists develop digital promotion strategies for websites, email and social media. Despite high unemployment, "consumer spending is still happening," Gimbel says. Most of these jobs can be landed with a bachelor's degree and experience in digital marketing.
Pay: Managers earn $80,000 to $120,000, Gimbel says. Starting salaries are closer to the $60,000 range.
ACTUARY
COVID-19 and other recent calamities such as hurricanes and floods have elevated the job of actuaries, who analyze the financial impact of risks. Most people associate actuarial work with forecasting mortality rates for pricing life insurance. But it goes far beyond that, says Brad Whatley, senior vice president at insurance recruiting agency Jacobson. Actuaries quantify the risk of disease for health insurers and the cost of damage from natural disasters for property and casualty insurers. BLS projects a robust growth rate of 20 percent through 2028. "It's a sought-after skill set," Whatley says. Actuaries develop models that are tested to ensure that the variables selected are statistically significant, he says. Actuaries have bachelor's degrees in math, finance or economics and become professionally certified.
Pay: The median pay is $108,350, according to BLS, and seasoned actuaries can earn $200,000 or more, Whatley says.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS MANAGER
A year ago, companies were scrambling for talent. In the depths of the pandemic, sadly, companies are laying off workers, furloughing and downsizing. Instead of needing recruiters, companies require HR managers with a soft touch, says Tom Gimbel, CEO of staffing agency LaSalle Network. "You may need to terminate jobs, manage people working remotely and otherwise deal with people's fears and inhibitions," he says. Beyond COVID these managers handle compensation and benefits, leaves of absence and succession planning. Managerial positions in HR usually require a bachelor's degree, and sometimes a master's is preferred.
Pay: Senior human resources managers earn median pay of $116,720, according to BLS. Less seasoned managers will earn $65,000 to $100,000, Gimbel says.

Those of us working through the COVID-19 era may be tiring of video conference calls. It's easy to get Zoomed out, dreading the next "virtual" meeting. But a Zoomer about birding? That's different. 
I couldn't wait to log on for the 2020 Illinois Young Birder Virtual Symposium. The recent Saturday morning confab was time well spent, and ended with a flourish as keynote speaker Kenn Kaufman addressed the kids and took their questions. Kaufman tuned in for the entire symposium, listening to the presentations by some of our state's top young birders and sharing his own perspectives in small doses. There is no bigger fan (and coach) of youth birding than Double K, one of the hobby's rock stars. The symposium is an annual gathering for Illinois Young Birders, a birding club for kids, teens and young adults ages 9 to 18. Administered by the Illinois Ornithological Society, ILYB aims to "foster and ignite a passion for birding among young people, provide community, promote conservation, investigate careers in birding, build positive relationships with other birding groups and, most of all, to have fun!" The fun part is easily achieved through monthly field trips to birding hot spots around the state, primarily in the Chicago region. Of course, ILYB members are usually birding somewhere every weekend. These kids eat, sleep and bird, and their field identification skills often surpass those of their elders. The symposium showcased other skills, including sketching, painting and photography. A slideshow of member artwork and photos played to a soundtrack that included "Birding" by the Swet Shop Boys, a tune worthy of your investigation. Earlier this year, one of the symposium participants, 14-year-old Gracie McMahon from Rockford, was named 2020 Young Birder of the Year by the American Birding Association. Her presentation to ILYB summarized her contest entry, including required elements focusing on conservation and community action. In 2019, Gracie launched a public outreach project in which she hand-painted 52 rocks with different species of birds. Each rock was numbered, with a message on the back: "What bird is this?" along with sandbluff.org, the website of the Sand Bluff Bird Observatory, where Gracie volunteers. The rocks were placed throughout the Rockford area for random people to find. The finders could then go online to watch a video about their bird and receive an invitation to visit Sand Bluff. Gracie and other SBBO volunteers created a short video for all 52 birds. "My project wasn't for people who were already interested in birds," Gracie said. "It was for people who knew nothing about them and weren't aware that birds need our help. Hopefully now they are, and they will continue to expand the birding community." Other symposium presenters were Peter Tolzmann, speaking about the human impact on birds; John Fabrycky on birding in Israel; and Oliver Burrus, sharing insights about data science and "machine learning." Part of Oliver's talk covered iNaturalist, a useful app for helping ID virtually any living thing. Kaufman closed the event with an inspiring talk that reached beyond birding to show how everything in nature is connected. The kids were mesmerized, the way Little Leaguers would be if Anthony Rizzo showed up to their baseball practice. Everyone on the Zoom, it seemed, had read Kaufman's "Kingbird Highway" at least once. "Birds unite us," he said, and "Birds will lead you to everything else in nature." Kaufman reflected on growing up in Indiana and how, at age 6, he learned to put a name on the blackbirds grazing in his yard. They were common grackles and European starlings — not the most exciting "spark birds," he admits, but they were enough. The challenge of finding other birds to identify hooked him on birding. Not surprisingly, as a teen, Kaufman's favorite book was "Wild America," the classic bird-finding travelogue by Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher, published in 1955. A few of the ILYB members had read it as well, which thoroughly impressed me. Kaufman wrapped up his virtual visit with a call to action, encouraging everyone to share their knowledge and passion with others. "We don't have to make people into rabid birders," he said. "If you can get them to care about birds, to have some interest, then they are likely to support bird conservation in the future. We need a lot more people like that." The message resonated, but was hardly necessary. Not with this group. Young birders, the serious ones, are among the hobby's best ambassadors. We need a lot more of them, too. Visit illinoisyoungbirders.org to learn more and perhaps buy a membership ($10) for the future ornithologist in your life. * Jeff Reiter's column appears monthly in Neighbor.

What TV viewers should know about following election night returns

Whether it was CNN beaming holograms of its far-flung correspondents onto the set, or Dan Rather's folksy play-by-play ("This race is shakier than cafeteria Jello"), election night was once an occasion that TV news greeted with giddy, self-promoting flair. Not this year. Amid projected historic turnout — and historic national anxiety — media organizations plan to strike a more somber, deliberate tone. They will contend with staffs dispersed by the coronavirus shutdown, ballot-counting rituals upended by a tsunami of early and mail-in votes, and a polarized climate in which President Donald Trump has attempted to sow doubt about the integrity of the process. In conversations over the past week, top officials at ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and The Associated Press answered our questions about following the election results with them this year. 
* * * Should viewers expect to have a result of the election on Nov. 4? Nobody knows, and news executives say they are prepared for the potential of the count going on well into the next day — or beyond. "Obviously, there's a strong possibility that we won't be able to project the winner" on Tuesday, said James Goldston, ABC News president. News directors say they have run dress rehearsals with their data scientists, statisticians and on-air talent to prepare for every eventuality of how election night might unfold — and now, says CBS News President Susan Zirinsky, "we have to prepare the audience: It may not be over that night, it may take days." Which is why "we have no illusion of going off the air," said Marc Burstein, a senior executive producer at ABC. "We've told everybody not to plan on going home, and then we'll come back to do it on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday." * * * What's changed since the last presidential election? Many television news anchors appeared visibly shocked on election night 2016 as the vote tallies that would propel Donald Trump into the White House rolled in from across the country. That misreading chastened the whole industry. This year, "we aren't going in with any narrative or set of expectations," said Noah Oppenheim, president of NBC News. "We are going to talk about the facts and not get ahead of them." To remind his staff to be cautious and prepared, CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist distributed copies of the testimony news executives gave to Congress when they were called to explain how the television networks got things so wrong in 2000 — the night they called Florida for Gore, then for Bush, then realized it was too close to call. * * * How will the networks get their information on how the vote is going throughout the night? As they have for nearly two decades, the big three broadcast networks and CNN will join as the National Election Pool to share data collected by a firm called Edison Research, which conducts exit polls — via both in-person and phone surveys of people who have already voted — to anticipate the trends within this year's electorate. While "a handful of people at each network" will be permitted to review the exit-poll data during the day, they will not be allowed to report it until 5 p.m. Tuesday, said Edison executive Joe Lenski. Edison also will collect the actual vote tallies from across the country as they are released by local jurisdictions. But Fox News and the AP left the pool after 2016 and have struck out together, hiring a research operation affiliated with the University of Chicago to help them prepare their projections. Arnon Mishkin, head of Fox's decision desk, said his organization was disappointed with 2016's exit polling, which skewed the results by capturing a disproportionate number of younger and college-educated voters — many of whom lean Democratic — and didn't fully probe the voting sentiment of mail-in and early voters. What this means is that for the first time since 1988, you'll see not one but two different polls of the electorate as you flip the channels. * * * How will the huge number of mail-in votes affect election night coverage? In past years, viewers were accustomed to hearing reports about the growing vote tally, tracked by the "percentage of precincts reporting," which enhanced the illusion of a steadily moving horse race. But what goes on in the precincts is more abstract this year, thanks to the large number of mail-in votes — many of which won't be calculated until after the in-person vote. So news executives promise they will explain the vote tally in its full context at every step. "You'll hear about Election Day in-person voting. You will hear about preelection in-person voting. And you will hear about mail-in voting," said David Chalian, CNN's political director. Those distinctions are important, networks say, because each cohort is expected to skew in different directions. Expect to hear television anchors to frame the results in terms of "percentage of the expected vote" instead of the "percentage of precincts reporting." * * * What's this talk about a "red mirage" or a "blue mirage"? Preelection opinion surveys have showed that this year, Democrats have a much greater propensity to vote by mail than Republicans. So depending on when a state plans to tally its mail-in ballots, there could be big swerves in the results throughout the evening. "We have to explain to the viewer what we know about those vote totals, because it could help them understand why a state may appear red initially on the map, but we believe that it may shift blue and that you shouldn't be surprised by that and vice versa," said Chalian. For example, said Fox News's Mishkin, there are two states where people are most likely to "draw inappropriate conclusions" — Florida, which will count its early votes first, possibly making it seem deceptively blue in the early hours, and Pennsylvania, where Election Day votes are counted first, possibly making it seem deceptively red until all the early and mail-in ballots are cast. * * * Why does it even matter what the networks project on election night? In 1980, NBC News used exit polling data to call the state of California for Ronald Reagan early in the evening, and Jimmy Carter conceded the election before the state's polls had closed, which hurt other Democratic candidates in the Pacific time zone when those voters didn't bother to show up. In 2000, based on vote and polling information from a now-abandoned research firm, the networks made the premature botched calls about Florida. The Associated Press was notably alone in saying it could not make a call based on the vote that night. But the contradictory calls on network television helped fuel confusion through the ensuing recount. This year, "being right is of absolute importance, and being first is less so," said Oppenheim. "We have a tremendous responsibility election night and this year more than ever. Everything we report needs to be bulletproof." * * * How will the networks call the race? The anchors may be the voice of authority in delivering the news, but it's not up to them to make the call. Each network relies on an in-house staff typically called a "decision desk" — a cadre of experts in data science and political science who look at historical voting patterns and compare them to real-time data as the vote comes in. They sit apart from the anchors and analysts you see on air. In 2012, when guest commentator Karl Rove disputed Fox's decision to call Ohio for Barack Obama, then-anchor Megyn Kelly had the cameras follow her down the hall to get Mishkin to explain his projections. Mishkin stood his ground and was soon proved right. (All the networks tout the independence of their decision desks, but in 2000, Fox's was run by John Ellis, who spent time on the phone that night sharing observations with his cousins — then-candidate George W. Bush and then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush — and prematurely called Florida for Bush even before the other networks. Fox says that its present-day decision desk doesn't have contact with campaigns.) This year, expect the announcements to come with a dose of math homework, as news organizations plan to show their work. "Every time we call a state for one of the two candidates, we are going to do a small but robust piece of explanatory journalism that we will put out as fast as possible to explain why the AP called that race," said Associated Press Executive Editor Sally Buzbee. "This isn't magic. It's math and analysis." And editors are vowing a "99.5% certainty" behind each call. "We do not call a race until we are absolutely sure that there is no way the trailing candidate can catch up," added Buzbee. One added potential for drama is the somewhat different data that AP and Fox will be working with, apart from the National Election Pool networks, since the two sets of pollsters will work with different sets of questions. "The public will be well-served by the fact that there are two entities conducting that poll," Mishkin said. * * * What will the media do if Trump attempts to declare victory prematurely, as some have speculated he might? Network executives did not explicitly say whether they would air such a speech or not; instead, they promise to report the most accurate news about what's going on, no matter what one of the candidates says. "Our job is to bring facts and context to those facts on election night," said CNN's Chalian. "Votes are facts. If someone declares victory prior to receiving 270 electoral votes and prior to CNN being able to project a winner, we will make sure to make those facts clear to the audience as we do each and every day." * * * How are the networks going to fill all those hours if the vote takes a long time? It's possible that you'll be watching the equivalent of a televised civics class. This year, you can expect the news to go deep on the processes behind mail-in voting, the mechanics of the electoral college, what happens in the case of a tie, the expectations for a peaceful transfer of power and so forth. And as they deliver news, they promise they'll do everything they can to explain where it came from, how they got it, and what it means. "When the hour comes, and the polls close, we are going to characterize every state that has closed: likely, leaning tossup, late-in-the night call," said Zirinsky of CBS. "But what we have to maintain very clearly to the audience is what we know, how we know it. We're educating the public on how we are making this assessment."

Creve Coeur-based Benson Hill reels in $150 million in ag-tech company's latest round of funding

Benson Hill, the rising "food tech" company based in Creve Coeur, wrapped up a recent funding round by attracting $150 million from prominent investors.
The haul is more than Benson Hill has raised in its eight-year history. It's also among the top rounds ever raised in St. Louis' growing biotechnology industry. The company said its total funding of $283 million trails only Galera Therapeutics, a drug startup, among biotech firms founded in the region.
Benson Hill combines biotechnology and data science to enhance the nutritional qualities and sustainability of crops. While much of its work centers on commodities like soybeans, the company has also helped Mars protect its chocolate supply by developing cacao trees that are more resilient to threats from climate change and disease.
Benson Hill's leaders say the new money will help fuel product development, and "talent build-out." The company currently employs about 190 people, most of whom work at its newly opened Creve Coeur headquarters. It built the new facility to accommodate growth, and is currently hiring for about 20 new positions.
The money will also help ensure that the company can meet growing customer demand.
"That is a key emphasis for us at this stage of our growth," said Matt Crisp, Benson Hill's president and chief executive.
The company's work on new, high-protein soy products drove investor interest, Crisp said, as it's linked with the fast-growing "alternative, plant-based protein category."
Crisp said the latest round of funding attracted influential partners from three continents: North America, Europe and Asia. Investors include GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and agribusiness giant Louis Dreyfus Co.
Crisp sees their investment as "an acknowledgment that the farmer and the consumer really deserve to be linked in a way that our current food system has not allowed them to be."
Looking forward, the company intends to maintain a special emphasis on proteins and vegetables, Crisp said. Many vegetable types, he noted, have not seen as much genetic research and modification as staple commodity row crops, like corn, that form the base of modern food regimes. That makes them an appealing frontier for Benson Hill.
"It's a category of crops that have gotten pathetically little innovation dollars, historically," said Crisp.

TOP 10 MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES CHICAGO'S

There's no better time than the depths of a global pandemic to step back and think hard about invention and innovation. Entire industries have been upended by the coronavirus, while others have received a turbo boost. This year's edition of Crain's Most Innovative Companies is full of examples of businesses that have reinvented themselves-often more than once-to adapt to changes and emerge stronger than ever. There are some surprising upstarts that are reinventing existing industries, from consumer electronics to heavy industry, with cutting-edge innovation, especially the internet of things. This is our ninth edition of the Most Innovative Companies list, compiled in partnership with Ocean Tomo, an intellectual property advisory, investment-banking and consulting firm, which evaluates the patents produced each year by Chicago-area companies and ranks them based on quality.
1. BRETFORD MANUFACTURING What it does: Computer charging carts Patents last year: 5
Decades ago, Bretford Manufacturing made the audiovisual carts for film projectors and TVs in schools. Now it's making carts to store and charge laptops. There's been a lot of innovation in between.
The Franklin Park company was founded in 1948 as a contract manufacturer, spitting out everything from hair dryers to barbecue grills, before making its own products.
"We're a U.S. manufacturer with a lot of challenges to compete. The only way we could survive is to innovate," says Chris Petrick, third-generation CEO of Bretford, which employs about 200. "We can't just be a metal bender or durable goods manufacturer. If you do that, you're going to get whipped. We have to use technology to provide value and separate ourselves from the metal box and rolling cart."
Bretford was good at providing power for AV equipment, and it evolved from carts to furniture, outfitting things like conference rooms and computer labs in schools.
Last year, it received patents for a power strip used in classrooms to allow multiple laptop users to plug in safely from a single outlet, as well as mobile lockers used by schools and companies to recharge and protect tablets and laptops.
The company claims to have begun selling the first commercial charging cart for laptops in 1999. The charging cart almost didn't survive, but then the company landed a partnership with Apple in 2008. The carts have evolved, allowing for machines to be updated automatically and have data wiped between uses. Bretford developed software to allow customers to manage the devices remotely.
The coronavirus has schools focused less on carts needed to haul and store computers on-site, but Bretford is getting a lift from corporate users, such as hospitals and manufacturers. With more employees working from home, its lockers fill a different need: touchless tech support. "If a computer breaks, they can just drop off a computer for a no-touch swap," Petrick says.
2. UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES What it does: Data-analytics software for industrial companies Patents last year: 15
Uptake Technologies helps companies keep their equipment running by having a better idea of when it might fail.
Groupon co-founder Brad Keywell launched the company in 2014 using Big Data to improve industrial performance. Uptake uses data captured by sensors on trains, construction equipment, wind turbines, trucks and the like to save companies money by making their machines perform better.
Several of the innovations that landed Uptake on Crain's Most Innovative Companies list are linked to its Radar product, which monitors vast amounts of data coming from sensors on rail cars, trucks and other equipment, applying algorithms to the information.
"We're able to see patterns in data leading up to failure," says Brian Silva, a director of data science at Chicago-based Uptake. "For on-highway trucks, unplanned failures can be very expensive repairs."
The company says it saved one customer $50,000 engine replacements by recommending $8,000 repairs. Uptake estimates its software helps customers reduce maintenance costs by as much as $1,250 a year per truck.
Uptake also developed a way to do virtual load tests on locomotives, rather than pulling them out of service.
"Industrial data is different from other kinds of data," says Dennis Lee, Uptake's deputy general counsel. "There are so many challenges: in gathering it, processing it, then providing it to the customer in a way that's useful."
Uptake, which grew to more than 800 employees in its early days but has shrunk to about one-third of that size, has generated 33 U.S. patents, including 15 granted last year. One of those patents, for determining health scores for equipment or systems, was cited in patents by IBM, Equifax and others.
3. RTC What it does: Retail shelf display systems Patents last year: 12
Walk into a store, and RTC's innovation is all around you. For decades, the Rolling Meadows-based company has been making retail shelves smarter, sturdier and easier to stock.
It's one of the top makers of retail displays-customized wood, metal and plastic devices that show off and dispense everything from drink bottles and razor blades to shoes and audio equipment. The company also has been a top performer on Crain's Most Innovative Companies list for the past five years.
Recent innovations include pushing the internet of things from the loading dock to the store shelf.
"There is incredible pressure on physical retail to become more and more cost- and space-efficient," says CEO Richard Nathan, whose father, Walter, founded the company in 1950 as a maker of cardboard tubes. "Our patents can bring inventory tracking and reporting down to the individual product, which then allows the store to react more quickly to low- or out-of-stock product. Out-of-stocks on a store visit is another sale for Amazon."
RTC received a patent last year on a wireless-communication hub that allows retailers to receive real-time information from sensors on store shelves. The technology, which is related to earlier innovations that included bringing digital messaging capabilities to the edges of shelves, gives stores the ability to communicate with customers, manage inventory and disseminate real-time video images to deter theft.
"We believe there are countless opportunities to leverage wireless technology, a network of sensors and intelligent software. We don't understand what all of the opportunities are, but we are ready to implement solutions as we figure it out," Nathan says.
4. GREENLEE TOOLS What it does: Electrical tools Patents last year: 9
Even tools are getting smarter.
Rockford-based Greenlee, a maker of tools for electrical contractors, brought digital technology to the mechanical process of bending conduit, the pipe that contains the electrical wiring in most buildings.
The software takes computer-aided design drawings, or digital blueprints, and translates them into step-by-step instructions for the electrical worker, eliminating manual calculations and guesswork. Integrating directly with CAD drawings allows contractors to bend conduit in their shops, rather than on the job site.
The digital conduit bender, introduced about 18 months ago, can improve efficiency by 10 to 15 percent, says Rob Trefz, Greenlee's vice president of marketing. It's one of the innovations that landed Greenlee, a business of Emerson Electric, on the Most Innovative Companies list.
"The whole tool industry is becoming much more active in the patent space," says James Malackowski, CEO of Ocean Tomo, a patent-valuation and intellectual property advisory firm that evaluated the patents and ranked the companies on Crain's Most Innovative Companies list. "You're buying more complex systems when you buy tools."
Greenlee was founded in 1862 as a barrel maker but eventually found itself in the woodworking-tools business, inventing the hollow chisel for mortising. Products soon included tools for making holes in metal for electrical applications, as well as conduit benders and wire and cable pullers. It added fish tapes, crimpers and cutters, as well as installation and test equipment.
It's still in the business of making holes. The company received a patent last year for a redesign of a popular multipurpose drill bit, improving its cutting speed by reformulating the alloy and its coating. The new product will hit the market soon.
5. HOLLISTER What it does: Medical products Patents last year: 18
Making a product that works is hard enough, and making it disposable is sometimes harder than making it last. Making a product that does both is where the real innovation comes in.
Hollister, a medical-products manufacturer in Libertyville, makes its second straight appearance in the Top 10 of Chicago's Most Innovative Companies list. Among the most innovative of its 18 U.S. patents issued last year are advances in catheters, including one that's flushable.
"We're trying to make the experience for the customer better and easier: an extension of that is making these products more sustainable from an environmental standpoint," says Seamus Fitzpatrick, Hollister's senior director of research and development. "When the catheter is used, the idea that it doesn't leave as much material behind and add to the amount of waste, that's a game-changer."
Hollister researchers worked on the problem for several years. "It took a tremendous amount of trial and error," Fitzpatrick says. "The level of chemistry and materials you use are a lot more sophisticated so that they remain functional to work as a catheter but disintegrate when you flush it down the toilet."
Hollister was founded in 1921 as a printing company, but it reinvented itself as a medical-products maker. The company is owned by its roughly 4,500 employees.
"New products are the lifeblood of Hollister," says Paola Wisner, vice president of R&D. "One of the beauties of being a private company is we're not being held to the quarterly results that public companies are. It enables us to make decisions for the long term, even when times are difficult, like we're seeing right now in a pandemic. Sometimes the best innovation comes in difficult times."
6. FLEXTERRA What it does: Flexible electronics Patents last year: 9
The key to fulfilling the promise of wearable electronics is to make them flexible.
Flexterra, a Skokie-based startup, earned patents last year for bendable displays, flexible circuitry and other materials that can be used in wearables. Some devices are flexible, but their electronics aren't, making them less durable. Flexterra solved the problem with chemistry, coming up with a way for new, more flexible materials to carry an electrical charge.
The company traces its roots to Polyera, which spun out of the lab of Tobin Marks, a chemistry researcher at Northwestern University and a prolific inventor.
Flexterra, which has 20 employees, licenses its technology to companies that make electronics. But it declines to name the customers or describe the specific products.
"Wearables and smartwatches is one of the key areas of application of our technology, but we are also collaborating on multiple industrial applications where flexible and/or highly robust displays are required, such as integration of displays into tracking items and inexpensive circuits for sensors," says Antonio Facchetti, Flexterra's chief technology officer and an adjunct professor of chemistry at Northwestern.
7. MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL What it does: Snack foods Patents last year: 28
When it comes to developing snack foods, innovation comes in many forms. There's the flavor, texture and packaging.
But it's not just about what the consumer can see and taste: It's about how it makes them feel.
Mondelez International received 28 patents last year, including one for its BelVita breakfast biscuits, which got their start in Europe and launched in North America in 2012. The biscuit contains specific starches and other ingredients that allow it to release energy into the body for four hours after it is consumed.
Though Mondelez is best known as the maker of Oreos, it has been delving deeper into wellness snacks in an effort to respond to consumers' desire to eat healthier.
The Chicago-based company has rolled out several healthy snacking brands in recent years and is working on more, says Brigette Wolf, head of SnackFutures Innovation at Mondelez. The U.S. is a hotbed of innovation surrounding well-being products.
"This is where we're now seeing what else can we develop for customers here."
The team launched three new brands last year. Ruckus and Co. is designed for kids with products like smoothies that are made from simple ingredients. Dirt Kitchen Snacks, with air-dried veggie and nut mixes, aims to satisfy the demand for quick vegetable-based foods. And CaPao, a plant-based snack, uses often-wasted parts of the cacao fruit, from which chocolate is derived.
Healthy snacks offer an important opportunity for Mondelez, says Darren Tristano, CEO of Chicago-based research and consulting firm Foodservice Results. "We seem to be moving toward a culture of grazers. As a result, the healthier foods are becoming more and more prominent and attractive to customers."

8. FORTUNE BRANDS HOME & SECURITY What it does: Cabinets, doors, plumbing and security products Patents last year: 10
For the past five years, Nicholas Fink has been on a mission to transform Fortune Brands Home & Security-a staid maker of faucets, cabinets, doors and locks-from analog to digital.
Today, you can talk to your faucets. But the real innovation is behind the scenes: in a digital valve that can cut water usage 50 percent in a shower, or an algorithm that can detect a small water leak or a catastrophic failure-and shut off the main automatically.
A padlock controlled by a smartphone can give a neighbor or a UPS driver one-time access to a storage shed for a specified time. A lockbox controlled with a smartphone can point users to within a foot of its location. Your front door is about to get smarter, too.
Deerfield-based Fortune Brands introduced its first Bluetooth-connected padlock five years ago. Last year, it received patents for security features that authenticate users' identities, as well as camera integration.
"Moving a portfolio this big, a $6 billion company, from analog to digital has been exciting," says Fink, whose company won five Best of Show awards at the Consumer Electronics Show this year. "At the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show, we won Best of Smart Home two years in a row," he says. "We beat out LG. We beat out Samsung."
Fink, who previously ran the Moen business and became CEO in January, is giddy about a voice-controlled faucet. "In April, we rolled out a COVID hand-washing update that gives you a precise temperature for 20 seconds. It's the first time we'd had a software upgrade to a hardware product in response to something happening in the world-kind of like a Tesla. It's unbelievably cool we could do that."
The wow factor doesn't come cheap or easy. "It was a huge investment," Fink says. "We've had to significantly boost our digital and electronic engineering hires."
But the payoff is potentially big and long lasting. "These are platforms, whether it's security or it's plumbing. Now we could control water digitally," Fink adds. "It's allowed us to roll out kitchen faucets, control the main, then how the main will interact with your kitchen faucet, your shower-even detect what might be happening with your sump pump."
9. ISCO INTERNATIONAL What it does: Wireless communications software Patents last year: 19
Wireless carriers are scrambling to keep up with our ever-increasing dependence on smartphones. One way is to build new networks. Another is to make them more efficient.
That's where Isco's software comes in. Its algorithms help streamline the links between cellular towers and phones, cleaning up interference and allowing networks to handle more traffic and do it more efficiently. By automating the process with artificial intelligence, networks can be adjusted on the fly, which has proved particularly helpful since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
"One of the challenges for carriers is the pattern of traffic has changed from driving back and forth to work," says Amr Abdelmonem, the company's chief technology officer. "Now it's all day long. Users are in different locations than before."
Wireless communication is complicated, fast-changing technology, which is why Schaumburg-based Isco has been a regular on Crain's Most Innovative Companies list.
One of the big challenges facing wireless carriers is the addition of new frequencies as they deploy new radio spectrum, which is becoming more prevalent with the rollout of next-generation networks known as 5G.
"Traffic is going to continue to go up, and there are more frequencies being brought into the network," says CEO Gordon Reichard.
10. HORIZON THERAPEUTICS What it does: Pharmaceuticals Patents last year: 7
Horizon Therapeutics continues to ride the wave of its Ravicti treatment for urea cycle disorder, a rare metabolic disease that can cause a potentially fatal buildup of ammonia.
The company earned a spot on the Most Innovative Companies list for the second straight year with five follow-on patents to Ravicti. Urea cycle disorders affect the body's ability to remove waste after eating meals with proteins. Horizon acquired Ravicti in 2015, but the company is ramping up its own R&D efforts. It's adding a 20,000-square-foot facility with lab space in South San Francisco. The company also received FDA approval this year for Tepezza, a treatment for thyroid eye disease, a rare autoimmune disorder. Horizon acquired Tepezza three years ago.

Vedic Mathematics India's gift to the world

Vedic Mathematics, an ancient system of mathematics based on sixteen Sanskrit mathematical formulae/sutras Atharva Veda, can be used to solve any mathematical problem whether it's arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or trigonometry mentally! As the sutras were passed down over time, they were lost. However, thankfully, Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha ji Maharaja, the Shankaracharya of Govardhan Mutt in Puri between 1911 and 1918, re- discovered them. 
Vedic Mathematics is more than 10-15 times faster than the conventional mathematics. How do we say this? You can test it yourself. We tested a normal student to calculate 9998 x 9997. He took 85 seconds to compute the answer correctly whereas with the Vedic Method of Multiplication, he could do it in about 5 seconds. Not only did he become more confident in his ability, bubbling with energy and high self-esteem, but he also wanted to solve more problems, showing a remarkable increase in his interest. Twenty years ago, during my final year of engineering, newspaper articles on Vedic Mathematics published by a local newspaper drew my attention. My fascination towards the subject gradually developed and I sought materials so that I could teach myself the subject. In 2010, while I was volunteering for Jeeyar Educational Trust, I volunteered in both technical development as well as in daily activities. When they started a summer camp for the first time in Chicago area, I introduced Vedic Mathematics in addition to their customary activities: shlokas, bhajans, music, and art. Impressed with my work, Shri HH China Jeeyear Swamy, a Hindu spiritual guru, wanted me to write a book on Vedic Mathematics so that he could introduce it to his Vedic students at ashrama. With this great opportunity, I authored the book Vedic Math Made Easy in 2016 and dedicated it to him. I proceeded to design Vedic Math course curriculum, prepare material, and train others through the train-the-trainer program for both Jeeyar Educational Trust and later, North South Foundation. From there, I was able to educate over 1000 students, train more than 100 coaches, conduct classes for 32 different camps and events, and provide services for seven different organizations. I wish to continue my journey of spreading this Divine treasure which India has to offer to the world. Gayathri is an Electronics and Communication engineering grade from OU. She has masters in computer science from UIUC. She has done further studies in Data Science at John Hopkins University. Her passion for STEM has led her to learn subject like Vedic Math. In fact, in her spare time, Gayathri also wrote several articles on Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Embedded Systems.

BERLIN — Scientists say a comparison of 21 developed countries during the start of the coronavirus pandemic shows that those with early lockdowns and well-prepared national health systems avoided large numbers of additional deaths due to the outbreak. In a study published Wednesday by the journal Nature Medicine, researchers used the number of weekly deaths in 19 European countries, New Zealand and Australia over the past decade to estimate how many people would have died from mid-February to May 2020 had the pandemic not happened. The authors, led by Majid Ezzati of Imperial College London, then compared the predicted number of deaths to the actual reported figure during that period to determine how many likely occurred due to the pandemic. 
Such models of ‘excess mortality' are commonly used by public health officials to better understand disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of counter-measures. The study found there were about 206,000 excess deaths across the 21 countries during the period, a figure that conforms to independent estimates. In Spain, the number of deaths was 38% higher than would have been expected without the pandemic, while in England and Wales it was 37% higher. Italy, Scotland and Belgium also had significant excess deaths, while in some countries there was no marked change or even — as in the case of Bulgaria — a decrease. While the authors note that there are differences in the compositions of populations, such as age and the prevalence of pre-existing conditions that contribute to mortality rates, government efforts to suppress transmission of the virus and the ability of national health systems to cope with the pandemic also played a role. Amitava Banerjee, a professor of clinical data science at University College London who wasn't involved in the study, said it was well designed and had used standardized methods. He noted that the comparison between death rates in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, where the age of the population and the rates of pre-existing conditions such as obesity are similar, supports the argument that other factors contributed to the differing mortality figures. "Even if vaccines and better treatments for severe (COVID-19) infection are developed, the way to minimise excess deaths is to reduce the infection rate through population level measures," said Banerjee. These include lockdowns, protecting high risk groups,and establishing effective "test, trace and isolate" systems, he said. Germany, which like the United States was not among the 21 countries examined in the study, has seen fewer deaths so far in 2020 than in some recent years, according to the head of the country's disease control agency. While the reasons for this are complex and may take time to fully understand, a decline in hospital infections and the absence of any reported measles cases in Germany since March indicate that social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing play a role. "The measures that were introduced because of COVID have further effects, and they're positive, that much is clear" Lothar Wieler, who heads the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters in Berlin.

There are health care businesses that target specific conditions and offer online treatment. And there's a range of imaginative B2B services in IT and software, real estate, insurance and digital marketing.
During the pandemic, these firms have pivoted, putting their offerings online, helping clients navigate the crisis or donating goods and services. They're helping to put Chicago on the map as a growing center for entrepreneurship.
METHODOLOGY: The marketers featured did not pay to be included. Their profiles were drawn from nomination materials submitted. This list is not comprehensive. It includes only executives for whom nominations were submitted and accepted after an editorial review. To qualify for the list, the entrepreneur must have demonstrated revenue growth or capital-raising over three to five years. The businesses have revenue between $500,000 and $10 million or have raised capital in this range.
JORGE AGUILAR CEO Trove
Jorge Aguilar and co-founder Sean Duran leased a bedroom with a broken Ikea bed in Lincoln Park to make money to pay their student loans. Within three years they owned and managed a portfolio of 26 buildings on the North Side, including apartment hotels, student housing and co-living spaces. Having completed the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Tech Incubator at 1871, Aguilar's startup was accepted to the National Association of Realtors' accelerator program. Trove has grown at 150 percent per year since it started in 2016 and has revenue of $1.1 million.

In 2007, she started Metaphrasis, which offers on-site, telephonic, video and sign language interpreting as well as document translation. The company has grown to generate annual revenue of $770,000. Colón is president of the National Association of Women Business Owners' Chicago chapter and is the first Latina to hold that position. She also serves as board chair of the Norwegian American Hospital Foundation, where she raises money to support hospital programs. She is a co-author of "Today's Inspired Latina: Life Stories of Success in the Face of Adversity" and speaks often on Latinx concerns.
STAR CUNNINGHAM Founder and CEO 4D Healthware
Former IBM executive Star Cunningham has spent close to three decades building tech solutions for Fortune 500 clients. Today, she leads 4D Healthware, a digital health platform that helps patients track chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes remotely through wearable medical and wellness devices. Cunningham started the company with savings and money from family and friends and has raised $4 million in angel investments. The pandemic has sparked demand, and revenue is expected to grow fivefold to more than $5 million next year. The firm's COVID-19 kit collects critical biometrics including temperature and oxygenation levels. With this kit, 4D has successfully managed 98 percent of its COVID patients at home. Cunningham serves as vice president of venture-capital and private-equity firm CANN Capital Partners.
ANDREW DEGENHOLTZ Founder and president eMagazines
Startup eMagazines helps magazine publishers translate their print content to mobile platforms. Its automated software reflows digital content without the need to download an additional app. Andrew Degenholtz started the company in 2016 without outside investors, and it has grown to serve 15 million subscribers a month for almost 50 magazine publishers. When the pandemic forced children to transition to at-home learning, eMagazines worked with Time for Kids to translate the magazine's content to an online reader. Before eMagazines, Degenholtz launched entrepreneurial ventures in Chicago, including ValueMags, a website that sells magazines, and Oplytic, which helps marketers drive web and app traffic and measure the effectiveness of their marketing and communication strategies. He also co-founded Community Path Media, an effort to support local newspapers by collaborating on advertising strategy.
MICHAEL EPISCOPE Co-CEO Origin Investments
Michael Episcope co-founded Origin Investments, a private-equity real estate fund manager that uses a direct-to-investor business model. The company acquires, owns and operates office and multifamily properties in eight U.S. markets. Since its start in 2007, the firm has executed $1 billion in real estate transactions and has more than $600 million in assets under management. Annual revenue has grown to $6.5 million with 33 employees. Episcope and partner David Scherer began exploring real estate but found that many opportunities were offered only to large institutional investors. As a result, they began investing their own money and that of family and friends in real estate deals. The investor group has grown from 70 in 2006 to more than 1,000 today.
PAUL FEITH President Paul Gregory Media
Paul Feith is president of Paul Gregory Media, which focuses on mission-based organizations, particularly nonprofits that support underserved populations.

She's been involved in the launch of Expo Chicago, Art on the Mart and Blue Man Group.
REBECCA FYFFE CEO and director of research Landmark Pest Management
During her laboratory research on pesticide resistance, Rebecca Fyffe determined that traditional pest control methods were antiquated. She founded Schaumburg-based Landmark in 2008 with the goal of delivering a safer and more effective service that eliminates overreliance on pesticides and rodenticides and instead focuses on products that target the way insects feed and on sealing rodents out of structures. In 2012, Fyffe acquired ABC Humane Wildlife Control & Prevention and merged the firms. Landmark built its brand by aligning with Chicago restaurants, especially Michelin-starred restaurants and James Beard Award-winning chefs. The company serves restaurants, airports, government buildings, grocery stores and food plants, as well as residential customers. Landmark has grown to revenue of $8 million with a staff of 100.
DANNY GARDNER Founder and CEO Mesh++
Founded in 2017, Mesh++ makes solar-powered mesh nodes that provide Wi-Fi to outdoor spaces such as festivals and parks. Mesh++ started as Gardner's senior project in electrical engineering at the University of Illinois, exploring whether a solar device could provide internet access to areas with unstable power grids. The project was entered in the university's accelerator program and won, providing Mesh++ its first investment. The company won a contract to provide internet access to 2 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the next two years. In response to COVID-19, Mesh++ began working with mayors in Chicago, Champaign, Miami, New Orleans and Columbia, S.C., to establish e-learning networks for children in underserved areas. Mesh++ has raised $3.1 million in venture capital and National Science Foundation grants.
NANCY GIANNI Founder and chief belief officer GiGi's Playhouse
After Nancy Gianni's daughter GiGi was born with Down syndrome, Gianni launched a nonprofit to provide education and therapeutic programs to individuals with the condition. Since its start in 2003, GiGi's Playhouse Down Syndrome Achievement Centers has expanded to 50 locations and has additional locations under development. The Hoffman Estates organization is funded by donations and grants. During the pandemic, GiGi's Playhouse has shifted to virtual programs, with 28 live weekly national programs and 250 on-demand videos. Because fundraising events had to be canceled, Gianni organized a virtual run, walk and ride that raised $1.3 million. She speaks often to groups about Down syndrome. Before starting GiGi's Playhouse, Gianni was an independent contractor for the Chicago Tribune in advertising.
DEBRA GIUNTA Founder and director Design Dance
In 2008, Debra Giunta founded the dance education nonprofit that facilitates social and emotional learning for students through 12th grade. In the past three years, Design Dance has grown by 50 percent to $525,000 in revenue, and it serves 6,000 students annually. The city of Chicago provides 25 percent of revenue to increase arts education in Chicago Public Schools. Design Dance also collaborates with the Chicago Park District and the Art Institute of Chicago. During the pandemic, Design Dance has pivoted to offering virtual dance programs. Giunta has started other educational initiatives, with pop-up programs in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. In 2019, she teamed with the U.S. embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, to bring entrepreneurship education to young people throughout the Balkan region.
ADAM GROSSMAN Founder and CEO Block Six Analytics
Adam Grossman launched Block Six Analytics in 2016, which uses technology and analytics to value sponsorships. Clients include large companies that use sponsorships as marketing tools, marketing agencies and professional sports teams, including PepsiCo, Citigroup, the Cleveland Browns and the Detroit Lions.

PAUL HLETKO President Few Spirits
Before World War II in what is now the Czech Republic, Paul Hletko's grandfather's family owned a large brewery that was confiscated by the Nazis. The grandfather survived the Holocaust but wasn't able to recover the business. That inspired Hletko to start a micro/craft distillery in part to honor his family history. Hletko in 2011 opened Few Spirits in Evanston, which he thought was an appropriate location after it had been dry for decades following the repeal of Prohibition. The distillery produces bourbon, rye and single malt whiskey and gin. Revenue has grown to $2 million with a staff of six. Before starting the distillery, Hletko worked as an attorney specializing in intellectual property. He's a founding member, board member and former president of the American Craft Spirits Association.

It includes ratings for products and services: Consumers have shared 60,000 reviews of food, restaurants, bakeries and hotels across 79 countries. Spokin teams with food brands and retailers, enabling them to connect with consumers. Hultquist funded the startup through family and friends, as well as a future-equity investment.

In 2017, brothers Ryan and Aaron Letzeiser teamed to launch an insurance and risk-management platform for real estate investors. The brothers say the insurance space for real estate investors is slow, opaque and not built to give investors an advantage. Obie matches real estate assets with optimal insurance carriers based on risk profiles. Clients average 16 percent savings on quotes and receive them in less than 72 hours, the brothers say. Since its launch, Obie has grown to revenue of $2.3 million with a staff of 15. The pair completed the Y Combinator accelerator and raised $2.8 million in venture capital. Earlier, the brothers were managers at MAC Properties, which builds, renovates and manages rental apartments in Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City.

Equilibria was started last year out of two women's struggles to balance career, family and a variety of stresses. Coco Meers and partner Marcy Capron Vermillion, both serial entrepreneurs, launched a site for CBD, the nonintoxicating cannabinoid known for its relaxing and anti-inflammatory effects. In March, Equilibria closed a $1.97 million Series Seed equity round led by Salveo Capital, an alternative investment firm specializing in legalized cannabis, and Hyde Park Angels.

KANEY O'NEILL Founder, managing partner and president ONeill Contractors

O'Neill launched the Glenview company in 2007, and it has grown to revenue of $8 million with a staff of 22. In 2018, she completed a $2.6 million roofing project on a milelong building at Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital near Broadview. It was especially meaningful to her because the roof ended at a long-term care facility for patients with spinal cord injuries, the same facility where O'Neill had spent months rehabilitating. She serves on the state's Business Enterprise Program Council.
CHELSEA AND BRETT SHER Co-founders and vice presidents Against the Grain Pet Food

The Evanston women-owned investment adviser co-founded by Constance Teska was launched in 2006. Pluscios serves a mix of clients including public pension funds, endowments and family offices. Historically, small women-, minority- or veteran-owned investment firms were rarely used by large pension funds and endowments, Teska says. But she saw an opportunity in that pension funds have been looking to diversify their sources of investment advice. The firm, which has seen growth of 63 percent over the past three years, has a staff of six. Before starting Pluscios, Teska was a senior managing director at J.P. Morgan and held leadership positions at predecessor financial institutions. Pluscios developed a database of 250 women-, minority- and veteran-owned advisers across the country so it can assist pension funds and endowments looking to diversify.
LEO TROPEANO Founder and CEO Mugsy Jeans
As Leo Tropeano aimed to improve his style and search for better jeans, the brands he tried were uncomfortable. Not wanting to sacrifice comfort for style, he set out to fix the problem with Mugsy Jeans. Launched in 2016, the brand is approaching $10 million in revenue with a staff of nine. The Mugsy website sells jeans and chinos, most retailing at $98. The site also carries other menswear such as T-shirts and shorts.

On a wine tasting trip to Michigan in 2011, Bob Wilson wondered why it was so difficult to find artisanal wines on store shelves. He started Winestyr to create a better way for consumers to discover and purchase wine from the thousands of U.S. artisanal wineries, most of which lack national distribution. More than 110 wineries participate on the platform. Winestyr is funded through a mix of family and friends, angel investors and institutional capital. It has raised more than $6 million with investments from Chicago-based Continental Advisors and strategic investor Constellation Ventures. Revenue last year was $2.8 million, and the firm employs 11. With the closing of restaurants, wine shops and wine tasting rooms, Winestyr has provided a needed sales outlet for small wineries.
ROBERT YOSKOWITZ Co-founder and CEO Nullafi
Traditional cybersecurity involves scrambling to build higher and stronger walls to keep out increasingly sophisticated hackers. Robert Yoskowitz and his partners aim to refocus cybersecurity, removing the fallout of a breach, rather than failing to prevent one. They developed a proprietary masking technology that renders sensitive data useless to hackers but retains its integrity for authorized users. Nullafi initially was directed at consumers, but investors recommended refocusing the company as a software-as-a service B2B technology. It has eight full-time and six part-time employees. Nullafi has raised $4.5 million, funded by angel investors and Berlin-based Axel Springer Plug & Play Accelerator. Yoskowitz has sponsored networking events for entrepreneurs in the Chicago tech community, including some on cybersecurity. He has advised other startups on funding and product strategy.

Three Democrats and three Green Party candidates are running for three, 6-year seats on the board of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, a government agency responsible for spending more than $1.1 billion annually to perform essential functions in preventing flooding and keeping Cook County's waterways clean. Democrat incumbents Cameron "Cam" Davis of Evanston and Kimberly Neely DuBuclet of Chicago are joined on the ballot by Democrat Eira L. Corral Sepúlveda, the Village Clerk of Hanover Park, and Green Party candidates Troy Hernandez of Chicago, a data scientist and solution engineer; Tammie Vinson of Chicago, a Chicago Public Schools teacher; and Rachel Wales of Oak Lawn, a humane farming adviser and freelance writer. You can learn more about the candidates at camdavis.org, kim4water.com, eira4water.com, troyhernandez.com and mwrd-ilgp.org. Q. Why are you running for this office, whether for reelection or election for the first time? Is there a particular issue that motivates you?
 If so, what? What specific professional qualifications do you possess that would make you excel in this office? A. I have a Ph.D. in statistics and have been employed in Chicago's tech sector as an expert in data science, AI, and optimization for the last six years. Additionally, I've volunteered for the Pilsen Environmental Rights and Reform Organization for the last six years and with the Chicago R User Group for the last four years. I believe the most pressing issue facing the MWRD is legalized corruption via campaign contributions. Our uniformly Democratic Board of Commissioners have their campaigns financed by large engineering firms. When you have big engineering firms making big campaign contributions to MWRD candidates, you get big expensive engineering solutions at MWRD. If there were green infrastructure companies handing out campaign contributions, MWRD Commissioners might entertain more economical and efficient solutions like green roofs and permeable pavers. I don't take corporate campaign contributions. My goal is to serve the people of the district, not to leech taxpayers for my campaign contributors like typical Madigan Democrats. For a detailed list of my opponents' questionable campaign contributions, go here: southsideweekly.com/running-clean-water-mwrd-finances-2020/ Q. If you are an incumbent, describe your main contributions. Tell us of any important initiatives you've led. If you are a challenger, what would you bring to the board and what would your priority be? A. One of the questions a citizen frequently asks in voting for their MWRD Board of Commissioners is "Do I need a statistician as part of my Board of Commissioners?" The answer is "Yes!" since a statistician can help to optimize design, analysis and interpretation of results, and drawing conclusions. There is no commissioner on the board with my skills, experience, and knowledge. The board recently authorized a $300k contract to a politically connected vendor to update their website. That's outrageous. For that price, we could've hired a full-time employee for three years! My three priorities are to: 1. Align the incentives of the board with the priorities of the district's taxpayers. We need to reform campaign finance laws for the MWRD. I echo my proposal from six years ago to publicly finance our political campaigns. (Available at troyhernandez.com.) 2. Modernize the MWRD's technology to make the district operate more efficiently. This includes using low-cost sensors, aka an internet-of-things (IoT). 3. Prioritize our investments by performing statistical analyses on IoT data to optimize our investments in gray or green infrastructure. Q. Due to the old infrastructure of a combined sewage system, raw sewage may be released into rivers and the lake during a heavy rain. While efforts such as rain barrels are important, does the district have any long-term plans to address the underlying infrastructure issue? A. There are two underlying infrastructure issues. The first being combined sewers. The second being a lack of green infrastructure. As alluded to in a following question, the MWRD is a billion dollar a year agency with a fraction of the attention that the similarly sized Chicago Police Department is currently receiving. If the MWRD has long-term plans to help separate the sewer systems at large, it's not been widely reported. My thoughts on the matter are these: While approximately half of the municipalities within the district have separated sewer systems, given the scope of legacy investments in combined sewer systems in our other municipalities, it's highly unlikely that it's cost-efficient to replace every combined sewer system. However, it would be reasonable to explore targeted investments where separating the sewers makes sense. Regarding green infrastructure, rain barrels aren't going to be enough. We need to ramp up our investments in green infrastructure. As I write below, Milwaukee is committed to 74 times the amount of green infrastructure compared to Chicago: i.e. the largest combined sewer system in the district. Why does Chicago have to be last so frequently? Q. For years, not one suburban Republican has been elected to the board. Should the board be elected by regional districts? A. Given that Republicans get approximately one-third of the votes in Cook County in single-member district elections like the Senate race, it would seem reasonable to expect that they would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. Similarly, the Green Party wins approximately one-third of the vote in MWRD elections, so it would seem reasonable to expect that we would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. This has not happened. To quote a New York Times article on the subject: "The solution is to elect members through ranked-choice voting (RCV), a process in which voters rank listed candidates in order of preference ... In multimember districts, each party is allowed to run as many candidates as there are seats ... Voters would then vote for three candidates, in order of preference. One more tweak is necessary: Because a successful multimember district is one that fairly represents the different viewpoints in that district, you need to mathematically mandate vote thresholds that will guarantee winners. In a three-member district, each candidate would need to win more than 25 percent to be elected." Q. How do you rate the MWRD on transparency and the public's access to records? If you consider it adequate, please explain why. If you think improvements are needed, please describe them and why they are important. A. With an annual budget of over $1 billion, it's imperative that the public's interests are properly represented. While I'm sure my Democratic opponents will pat themselves on the back for their new inspector general (IG), let's remember that: 1. It was originally a Green Party proposal. 2. Some Democratic MWRD Commissioners tried to stall the appointment process. 3. The IG has already found that four commissioners have used their political email accounts, "to solicit MWRD employees ... for political purposes" in this election cycle. Our tax dollars are literally financing my opponents' campaigns against me. Moreover, in an underappreciated agency like the MWRD, increased transparency would not necessarily improve things. The public's appetite for MWRD information is limited. This is why it's the perfect patronage vehicle. For the average MWRD constituent, the less they have to think about us, the better. The priority should be to elect competent commissioners who will serve the public's interest. That's why I push hard on public campaign financing and RCV. If we can create the proper electoral systems and incentives for our elected officials, these issues take care of themselves. Q. What other issues, if any, are important to you as a candidate for this office? A. With a 1,200 character limit, this needs to be emphasized. Chicagoland has experienced its wettest May ever for the third year in the row! An MWRD engineer was quoted last year (on slate.com) saying, "It's now clear that this 50-year, multibillion-dollar project (Deep Tunnel) will not be sufficient to stop flooding in Chicago." And yet, the Democratic MWRD board continues to prefer big engineering solutions. They go on: "The Deep Tunnel is helpless to empty undersized sewers battling against supersize storms and sprawl ... Even the system's original engineers knew that its potential to solve neighborhood flooding would be limited by local infrastructure." Lastly, "the MWRD has committed to creating just 10 million gallons of green infrastructure capacity under its EPA consent decree. Compare that to ... Milwaukee, [which] now believes its green infrastructure will, by 2035 ... hold up to 740 million gallons of rain where it falls." Our priority should be to reduce flooding in our communities' homes, not to enrich our campaign contributors.

That's outrageous. For that price, we could've hired a full-time employee for three years! My three priorities are to: 1. Align the incentives of the board with the priorities of the district's taxpayers. We need to reform campaign finance laws for the MWRD. I echo my proposal from six years ago to publicly finance our political campaigns. (Available at troyhernandez.com.) 2. Modernize the MWRD's technology to make the district operate more efficiently. This includes using low-cost sensors, aka an internet-of-things (IoT). 3. Prioritize our investments by performing statistical analyses on IoT data to optimize our investments in gray or green infrastructure. Q. Due to the old infrastructure of a combined sewage system, raw sewage may be released into rivers and the lake during a heavy rain. While efforts such as rain barrels are important, does the district have any long-term plans to address the underlying infrastructure issue? A. There are two underlying infrastructure issues. The first being combined sewers. The second being a lack of green infrastructure. As alluded to in a following question, the MWRD is a billion dollar a year agency with a fraction of the attention that the similarly sized Chicago Police Department is currently receiving. If the MWRD has long-term plans to help separate the sewer systems at large, it's not been widely reported. My thoughts on the matter are these: While approximately half of the municipalities within the district have separated sewer systems, given the scope of legacy investments in combined sewer systems in our other municipalities, it's highly unlikely that it's cost-efficient to replace every combined sewer system. However, it would be reasonable to explore targeted investments where separating the sewers makes sense. Regarding green infrastructure, rain barrels aren't going to be enough. We need to ramp up our investments in green infrastructure. As I write below, Milwaukee is committed to 74 times the amount of green infrastructure compared to Chicago: i.e. the largest combined sewer system in the district. Why does Chicago have to be last so frequently? Q. For years, not one suburban Republican has been elected to the board. Should the board be elected by regional districts? A. Given that Republicans get approximately one-third of the votes in Cook County in single-member district elections like the Senate race, it would seem reasonable to expect that they would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. Similarly, the Green Party wins approximately one-third of the vote in MWRD elections, so it would seem reasonable to expect that we would win one out of three MWRD seats every two years. This has not happened. To quote a New York Times article on the subject: "The solution is to elect members through ranked-choice voting (RCV), a process in which voters rank listed candidates in order of preference ... In multimember districts, each party is allowed to run as many candidates as there are seats ... Voters would then vote for three candidates, in order of preference. One more tweak is necessary: Because a successful multimember district is one that fairly represents the different viewpoints in that district, you need to mathematically mandate vote thresholds that will guarantee winners. In a three-member district, each candidate would need to win more than 25 percent to be elected." Q. How do you rate the MWRD on transparency and the public's access to records? If you consider it adequate, please explain why. If you think improvements are needed, please describe them and why they are important. A. With an annual budget of over $1 billion, it's imperative that the public's interests are properly represented. While I'm sure my Democratic opponents will pat themselves on the back for their new inspector general (IG), let's remember that: 1. It was originally a Green Party proposal. 2. Some Democratic MWRD Commissioners tried to stall the appointment process. 3. The IG has already found that four commissioners have used their political email accounts, "to solicit MWRD employees ... for political purposes" in this election cycle. Our tax dollars are literally financing my opponents' campaigns against me. Moreover, in an underappreciated agency like the MWRD, increased transparency would not necessarily improve things. The public's appetite for MWRD information is limited. This is why it's the perfect patronage vehicle. For the average MWRD constituent, the less they have to think about us, the better. The priority should be to elect competent commissioners who will serve the public's interest. That's why I push hard on public campaign financing and RCV. If we can create the proper electoral systems and incentives for our elected officials, these issues take care of themselves.

'Food tech' company Benson Hill formally opens new headquarters in Creve Coeur

CREVE COEUR - Biotech firm Benson Hill, which touts itself as one of the fastest-growing food tech companies in the country, on Monday formally opened its new headquarters here - marking the occasion with an event that included a visit from U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.
The company combines biotechnology and data science to boost the nutritional attributes and sustainability of key crops and ingredients in the food industry. Much of its work has focused on improving staples such as soybeans, but the company has also landed contracts with food giants like Mars, helping the chocolate producer hone the genetic resilience of its cacao trees, which face growing risks from climate change and disease.
The St. Louis area claims the highest concentration of plant science doctorates in the world. Benson Hill said its new facility bolsters the region's position "at the forefront of the future of food."
"It's fascinating to see the combination of talent that you've put together here," said Perdue, speaking after a tour of the Benson Hill facility. "It's a fascinating effort here, and I wish you all the best."
The $52 million, 160,000-square-foot headquarters off North Warson Road will host an ensemble of experts in plant biology, agronomy, data analytics, machine learning, and food science. The building is housed within the 39 North plant science district, near other engines for agricultural research, such as the neighboring Danforth Plant Science Center.
Danforth Center researcher Todd Mockler co-founded Benson Hill in 2012 with Matt Crisp, the company's president and CEO. Benson Hill employs 190, and the new headquarters has capacity for 300. The company is working to fill a dozen positions now, said Crisp.
Essential employees began working in the building a couple months ago, with others phased in since then - a gradual approach taken amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Only a fraction of employees - 20% to 25% - are working inside the building now, but the new facility comes with features well-suited to the pandemic: "easy-to-sanitize furnishings," an air filtration system capable of eliminating airborne viruses, and fresh air circulation in lab spaces.
Executives lauded the building's opening on Monday, but noted that the work is more important inside, where experts will serve as a "bridge" between food producers and consumers.
"It's the convergence of these that creates real meaning," said Crisp. "This is really about the people. The people are the reason we're able to do this."
Mockler expressed excitement how resulting work could improve the lives of others through a better food system.
"That's just a milestone," he said of the building's completion. "It's not the final destination."

Pro-Trump group pays teens to post online

WASHINGTON — One tweet claimed coronavirus numbers were intentionally inflated, adding, "It's hard to know what to believe." Another warned, "Don't trust Dr. Fauci." A Facebook comment argued that mail-in ballots "will lead to fraud for this election," while an Instagram comment amplified the erroneous claim that 28 million ballots went missing in the past four elections. The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views — standing up for President Donald Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign. Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign. 
Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA's website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the activity. In response to questions from The Post, Twitter on Tuesday suspended at least 20 accounts involved in the activity for "platform manipulation and spam." Facebook also deactivated a number of accounts as part of what the company said is an ongoing investigation. The effort generated thousands of posts this summer on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, according to an examination by The Post and an assessment by an independent specialist in data science. Nearly 4,500 tweets containing identical content that were identified in the analysis probably represent a fraction of the overall output. The monthslong effort by the tax-exempt nonprofit is among the most ambitious domestic influence campaigns uncovered this election cycle, said experts tracking the evolution of deceptive online tactics. "In 2016, there were Macedonian teenagers interfering in the election by running a troll farm and writing salacious articles for money," said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. "In this election, the troll farm is in Phoenix." The effort, Brookie added, illustrates "that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than anything a foreign adversary could do to us." Turning Point Action, whose 26-year-old leader, Wheeling native Charlie Kirk, delivered the opening speech at this year's Republican National Convention, issued a statement from the group's field director defending the social media campaign and saying any comparison to a troll farm was a "gross mischaracterization." "This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online, not an anonymous troll farm in Russia," the field director, Austin Smith, said in the statement. He said the operation reflected an attempt by Turning Point Action to maintain its advocacy despite the challenges presented by the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many traditional political events. The group declined to make Kirk available for an interview. Turning Point dates to 2012, when Montgomery, retired from a career in marketing, heard Kirk, 18 at the time, deliver a speech at Benedictine University's "Youth Government Day." He called the address "practically Reaganesque," according to a 2015 profile in Crain's Chicago Business newspaper, and urged Kirk, a former Eagle Scout, to put off college in favor of full-time political activism. Kirk became the face of Turning Point, while Montgomery was "the old guy who keeps it all legal," he told the business weekly. The organization amassed prominent and wealthy conservative allies, including Richard Grenell, the former ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, and Foster Friess, who made a fortune in mutual funds and helps bankroll conservative and Christian causes. Both men sit on Turning Point's honorary board. Its standing rose significantly as Trump came to power. Turning Point USA brought in nearly $80,000 in contributions and other funds in the fiscal year ending June 2013, according to IRS filings, a fraction of the $8 million it reported for 2017 and $11 million for 2018. The group, which describes itself as the "largest and fastest-growing youth organization in America," claims to have a presence on more than 2,000 college and high school campuses. It hosts activist conferences and runs an alumni program. It also maintains a "Professor Watchlist" designed to expose instructors who "discriminate against conservative students, promote anti-American values and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." Kirk, the group's president and co-founder, has been embraced and promoted by Trump and his family. Speaking at Turning Point USA's Teen Student Action Summit last year, Trump hailed Kirk for building a "movement unlike anything in the history of our nation." A quote attributed to Donald Trump Jr., who has appeared at numerous Turning Point events, features prominently on the group's website: "I'm convinced that the work by Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk will win back the future of America." The online salvo targeted prominent Democratic politicians and news organizations on social media. It mainly took the form of replies to their posts, part of a bid to reorient political conversation. The messages — some of them false and some simply partisan — were parceled out in precise increments as directed by the effort's leaders, according to the people with knowledge of the highly coordinated activity.

Mizzou wins $12 million, 5-year contract to train NGA employees in St. Louis, Washington

ST. LOUIS - Several months after confirming the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is staying in St. Louis, the agency announced a $12 million contract to the University of Missouri's Columbia campus to train NGA employees.
The five-year contract to Mizzou's engineering school - the largest contract in the College of Engineering's history - is aimed at data science and "key education and training needs identified by NGA."
Curt Davis, director of the engineering school's Center for Geospatial Intelligence, said the process of acquiring the contract started more than a year ago. The NGA anticipates 1,800 working students in St. Louis and Washington participating in the graduate certificate program. Davis expects them to span from early career and beyond.
"Our faculty are thrilled to be able to support NGA's effort to equip its workforce with the data science skills necessary for NGA to make sense out of the overwhelming volume of government, commercial, and open-source geospatial information they have to deal with on a day-to-day basis," Davis said in a statement.
NGA employees will be paid for their time in these classes, Davis said. Beginning courses will likely be self-paced and online, with more advanced classes taught in person. Professors from Mizzou will teach the classes in St. Louis, but the university has contracted for teachers in Washington. Davis said Mizzou professors will travel to D.C. as needed.
When students are done with the program, they will have a graduate certificate in data science and a master's degree from the University of Missouri.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to break ground on the federal intelligence agency's $1.75 billion campus in mid-2017. St. Louis officials hope the campus will reshape the area northwest of downtown.

Students choose to attend Judson University for many reasons. Rabella Giyo, Class of 2020 and from Hoffman Estates, came to Judson after finishing at a local community college. "I wasn't sure about Judson until I was given the opportunity to meet a professor from my major," Rabella said. 
Now, Professor Leslie Kruser has become her mentor. "She has helped me in reaching my goals, both professionally and academically," Rabella added. Since joining Judson, Rabella has helped start the Judson Accounting Club and has gotten an internship through the Mary T. Wylie Scholarship Program, which gives accounting majors networking opportunities with top accounting firms and provides helpful training tools for passing the CPA exam. Judson University is a thriving Christian liberal-arts institution located conveniently at I-90 and State Road 31 in Elgin, on a pastoral campus framed by Tyler Creek and the Fox River. This fully accredited institution offers more than 60 programs for undergraduate students and graduate programs for architecture, education in literacy, organizational leadership, business administration, human services, clinical mental health counseling and ministry in leadership, as well as a doctorate of education in literacy. The university's adult degree completion program provides associate's and bachelor's programs. This spring the university focused on professional development by launching the nation's first fully applied data science boot camp targeted to corporate education. Judson's Data Science Bootcamp has simultaneous parallel paths for business professionals, coders and math/stats professionals. Judson also launched a new Professional Certification Exam Preparation Program that provides a fast, six-week prep course in the areas of Six Sigma (yellow, green, black belts), quality improvement, project management, production and inventory management, and human resources. To learn more about both new programs, visit JudsonU.edu/bootcamp/datascience and JudsonU.edu/certificateprep, respectively. Students in Judson's Division of Professional Studies can take classes at the Elgin campus, at a Rockford campus and online. Rockford students can also take advantage of the child care and Y memberships available through a partnership with the SwedishAmerican Riverfront YMCA. When Renee Luthe, class of '16 and '18, started her education in Judson's Adult Program, she was just looking for an accelerated course of study to help advance her career and support her family. The result, she says, was transformational. "I thought I was just walking into a degree … but really I was walking into academic, psychological, emotional and spiritual development, which is something that I didn't realize until the end," Luthe says. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in human services in 2016 and a master's in human service administration in December. Judson's programs have been key to the university's recognition as among the top tier of regional colleges in the Midwest as noted by U.S. News and World Report; listed as a military-friendly institution; and named as a Christian College of Distinction in Illinois. Additionally, students participate in many extracurricular activities, including nearly 21 organized sports competing in the NAIA and the CCAC. In 2019, Judson will begin its first football program. With an academically challenging environment and encouraging spiritual community, Judson lives out its vision to "shape lives that shape the world." To learn more about Judson University, visit JudsonU.edu.

The Scholar Athlete Program was the brainchild of Hall of Fame Baseball Writer Bob Broeg in 1965. Broeg wanted to honor high school seniors whose success was not only on the field, court or ice rink – students who excelled in the classroom as well.
For the 53rd year, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch is honoring local Scholar Athletes. These are young men and women who lettered in at least one varsity sport, are in the top 25 percent of their graduating class and are in good standing at their respective high school.
Join us in applauding this year's 161 St. Louis Post-Dispatch Scholar Athletes. The recipients are honored in today's St. Louis Post-Dispatch, online now at stlhighschoolsports.com and at a pre-game reception at this evening's St. Louis Cardinals game.

"Math has always been my favorite part of school and both of these courses are very math intensive.

My father has been one of the most supportive and upbeat parts of my life, and has taught me how to love everyone around me, love life, and be as happy as I can be. The unconditional love and support my parents have given me throughout the years (has) made all the difference.

Fever-monitoring company places Missouri at top of watchlist for coronavirus surge

ST. LOUIS - A health data company that tracks fevers with its internet-connected thermometers has placed Missouri at the top of its watchlist for a surge in COVID-19 cases in the next few weeks.
Kinsa Health, which created its smart thermometers eight years ago as an early warning system for the flu and other viruses, has sold or given out more than 1.5 million thermometers across the U.S. The thermometers are connected to an app, where users can also enter symptoms and receive advice.
With 83% to 99% of people with coronavirus infection experiencing fever, the thermometers now act as an early warning for outbreaks of COVID-19.
"We are seeing people the minute they become symptomatic and have that first inkling of, 'Oh I kind of don't feel well. I'm going to go take my temperature,'" said Nita Nehru, Kinsa's head of communications.
It can take several days before a person finally decides to make an appointment to get tested, then even longer to get results. The average time currently is three days, said Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.
Kinsa looks for unusual levels of fever in communities and an increasing rate of transmission among other thermometer users.
"Then we apply machine learning and data science to understand bigger trends for the entire population outside of just what's happening with the thermometer users," Nehru said.
So far during the pandemic, Kinsa's data gathered has been fairly accurate at predicting outbreaks three to four weeks in advance, according to an analysis by the New York Times.
In Missouri, Kinsa saw a steep increase in fevers and rates of transmission from mid to late June, which led to a spike in new coronavirus cases from mid to late July.
The numbers of new cases dropped throughout the first of half August; however, fevers and rates of transmission increased - and at a rate faster than any other state, Nehru said.
"We need to alert in Missouri and let them know that we are seeing this, and we have seen this in the past and it's following the same trajectory," she said. "That, coupled with the fact that schools are opening soon, led us to be concerned about a big surge and an even bigger surge in Missouri when schools reopen."
Areas within the state that are of particular concern, she said, include St. Louis, St. Louis County, St. Charles County and more recently Jackson County, which includes most of Kansas City.
UrbanFootprint, an urban planning software company, also includes Missouri on its list of top five states likely to see case spikes in the coming weeks.
The company uses Kinsa's data as well as signs of movement and traveling. It also considers risk factors that make communities vulnerable such as unemployment, risk of eviction and food insecurity.
Other states on the list are Washington, Illinois, Michigan and Texas.
The predictions are not exact, Nehru said. Kinsa is unable to forecast the number of cases or how long a surge will last.
The companies hope that local health departments, governments and relief agencies can use the warnings to consider business restrictions, prepare for increased needs for testing and medical supplies, and ramp up services such as food and rental assistance.
In response to requests for comment about Kinsa's warning, officials with the St. Louis, St. Louis County, St. Charles County and state health departments sent emails to the Post-Dispatch.
The officials stated that they rely on the expertise and data from multiple state and local agencies in determining strategies.
The St. Louis Department of Health pointed out that cases in the city have slowly declined since July 12, and the department's surveillance has not shown an increase above expected levels of fever or respiratory complaints.
Nehru said getting Kinsa's warning out to the public is also important.
"You can get that information to the person sitting in their home wondering, ‘Do I need to be increasing the disinfecting I'm doing at home? Do I need to be wearing a mask? Should I be more cautions going around my 90-year-old grandmother?'"

DINING HAUL - Some serious shout-out for STL from the food-infatuated folks at Yelp.
A recent look at recommendations filed on their restaurant review site puts our metropolis at No. 2 for the "Top 10 Foodie Cities."
The blurb for our metro states that we are a "Midwest hotspot" that "holds a wealth of to-die-for eateries."
A company release said its "Data Science team" looked at ratings, reviews, cuisine diversity and percentage of food photos posted to their site.
(For the record, "foodie" and "to-die-for" seem to be used without irony or sarcasm; not sure on "Data Science team.")
"From the s'mores french toast at Half and Half (Clayton) and the gaucho steak at Olive + Oak (Webster Groves), the Gateway City's food scene has something to offer for every meal," our blurb in the article states.
Other STL dining spots highlighted as being the most recommended by Yelp users were Broadway Oyster Bar and Union Loafers Cafe in St. Louis and the multi-site Mission Taco.
The only city to top us was San Francisco. Rounding out the list, Nos. 3-10, were: Honolulu; Plano, Texas; San Diego; Las Vegas; Richmond, Va.; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; and Austin.
AULD GREEN DEAL - For the 50th time, downtown St. Louis will play host to the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade at noon on March 16.
Leading this march will be parade founder and St. Louis Irish Consul Joseph McGlynn Jr.; parade committee chair Vincent Via; Irish guest of honor Aidan Davitt, a senator in Ireland; and honorary parade marshal Kevin Short, CEO of Clayton Capital Partners.
The parade will step off at noon from 20th and Market streets; proceed east on Market to Broadway; and south on Broadway to where it will disband at Clark Street. (Motorists take note: Market will be closed at 7:30 a.m. from Compton to Broadway.)
The parade will feature more than 130 units and 5,000 marchers. In the past, with accommodating weather, more than 350,000 people have attended the parade, organizers said.
Starting at 9 a.m., some inflatable balloons will be filled on the east side of Aloe Plaza, near Union Station.
Also at 9 a.m., the 41st Annual Michelob Ultra St. Patrick's Day Parade Run will begin. Both a 5-mile and a 3-kilometer run will be featured.
This year's runs will bring back the "Best Costume Award" competition, which in the past gave the crowd numerous running potatoes and several St. Patricks chasing snakes.
For information, call 314-241-7287 or go to irishparade.org.
The traditional St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dogtown, presented by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, will be held on St. Patrick's feast day, March 17.
The stepping off begins at 11 a.m. at Tamm and Oakland avenues. The following outdoor festival runs from 1 to 6 p.m. For information, go to stlhibernians.com.
SPEAKING O' GREEN ... - St. Louis is ranked as one of the top 20 cities in the nation when it comes to the "Best Cities for St. Patrick's Day."
Personal finance website WalletHub puts our fair burg at No. 18 out of the 200 largest cities in the U.S., higher than any of our major-city neighbors - other than Chicago, which finished at the top of the entire list.
The analysis was broken down into four main categories.
Our best showing, No. 10, was in the area of traditions, where the criteria included: number of parades, parties and festivals; share of population with Irish ancestry; number of Irish pubs and restaurants; and access to bars, a category in which we finished No. 3 in the entire U.S.
We were No. 49 when it came to having pleasant weather on the holiday, and No. 102 in the cost area, which took into account hotel, bar and restaurant prices. Our worst showing was in the safety category, where we were ranked No. 176.
The 10 best cities: Chicago; Philadelphia; Madison, Wis.; Boston; Tampa; Naperville, Ill.; New York; Pittsburgh; Rockford, Ill.; and Dayton, Ohio.

UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S COMPUTER VISIONARY

When Mike Franklin was being recruited to leave the University of California at Berkeley to head up the computer science department at the University of Chicago, it wasn't exactly love at first sight. As he got a tour of the department's proposed new home-the John Crerar Library, a onetime repository for scientific journals-Franklin considered the squat, dark, industrial-grade box and said, " 'There's not enough light.' They said, 'We can change that,' " he recalls. "I said, 'Hmm, maybe this could work.' "
And so workers cut big holes in the concrete walls for new windows, and today the space looks and feels more like a tech startup than a university. Opened in September, it's the most visible part of U of C's makeover of computer science that brought Franklin to Hyde Park two years ago. Windows may not seem like a big deal. But the renovation was a clear indication of just how serious U of C was about upgrading the program, and why Franklin was willing to leave Berkeley.
"It was a huge coup for (U of C President) Bob Zimmer to recruit him," says Tom Siebel, founder of legendary Silicon Valley database-software maker Siebel Systems, who endowed a professorship at Berkeley held by Franklin, as well as similar positions at the University of Illinois (Siebel's alma mater), Stanford and Princeton. "He's a giant who's universally respected, one of the innovators in Big Data. His academic credentials are second to none."
Franklin, who was head of Berkeley's top-ranked computer science division, is a leading researcher in cloud computing and data analytics who pioneered ways to do real-time analysis of massive data sets. Leaving the San Francisco Bay Area and Berkeley for Hyde Park and a less-prestigious program seemed like a long shot. Berkeley is in the cradle of the tech industry, where Franklin could collaborate with its biggest companies on research projects such as AMPLab, which resulted in Spark, an open-source software that has become the standard for working with and analyzing huge amounts of data. It's also a creative hotbed where students and faculty easily start companies, which Franklin also did, building Truviso, a networking software startup that was sold to Cisco Systems in 2012.
But the 57-year-old is a builder. Changes in academic programs, especially the top 20, can be measured in decades. U of C, ranked No. 30 in computer science and 15th in CS theory in 2018, according to U.S. News & World Report, had a strong enough foundation upon which to build a top-ranked computer science program.
"You can't build a top program, starting from scratch," Franklin says. "I was convinced the administration was 100 percent committed to building out a top-tier computer science department. It's an opportunity to step on the gas."
It helped that U of C raised more than $20 million from alumni donors for computer science as part of a long-term commitment of at least $100 million. The school is trying to transition from a place known for theory to creating technology, with an emphasis on data science, Franklin's specialty.
"We traditionally had a small computer science department that grew out of mathematics," says Edward "Rocky" Kolb, former dean of U of C's physical sciences division, who hired Franklin. "We want to be a national player and to be innovative. If we build a great department, the rankings will follow. Chicago isn't MIT or Berkeley: It will always be smaller. But we can build on the strengths of the university to have an impact in CS."
Franklin's hiring didn't go unnoticed-on or off campus. "People ask me about Mike and what's happening in CS," says Charlie Catlett, a researcher at U of C for nearly 20 years.
"The moment you attract someone like Mike, UIUC and Northwestern say, 'We need to compete,' " adds Andreas Cangellaris, provost at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was dean of engineering. "We also have someone we can collaborate with. There's a sense of excitement. I'm ecstatic to have him in the Midwest."
The real test long term is whether U of C improves in rankings and research grants. It historically has been seen as having a disadvantage in computer science because it doesn't have an engineering school, as U of I or Northwestern do. But data science is heavily rooted in math and statistics. "I think it's possible to have a top CS program today without having a traditional engineering program," Kolb says.
U of C also is responding to market demand, which is skyrocketing for computer science. Enrollment has at least doubled nationally and at U of C, Northwestern and the University of Illinois at Chicago in the past five years or so.
U of C joins Northwestern in an arms race in which both have built new facilities and are aggressively hiring faculty. "In academia, to grow a department, you add an appointment every decade," Kolb says. "Hiring in CS is difficult. We're not the only university who realizes the need. All of our peers are trying to build computer science. (Mike's) stature, vision and personality is a great tool in recruiting."
Franklin is halfway to nearly doubling faculty, adding 13 members, pushing the total to 35. His recruits have come from some of the nation's top schools, including Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon. Pedro Lopes, 32, who recently earned a doctorate from Hasso Plattner Institute in Berlin, says he chose U of C over some top 10 programs.
"I had a lot of choices. A lot of it has to do with Mike and the place and time where the department is," says Lopes, whose specialty is human-computer interaction, with an interest in wearable devices. "(U of C) was smaller and mostly dedicated to what computer science used to be . . . the theory. The version you see now is what CS is today, AI, human-computer interaction. I wanted to design how new students are going to see the field."
Franklin realizes the irony of a program trying to transition from theory to practical applications doing so from a building that recently housed stacks of printed scientific journals that have moved online. But on a tour, he points out new lab spaces where there are prototypes strewn about. In one, Ben Zhao, a professor who specializes in data mining and security, shows off a bracelet-like device he made with help from Lopes to thwart an automated assistant such as Alexa or Google Assistant. It's exactly the kind of collaboration for which Franklin became known at Berkeley's AMPLab (algorithms, machines and people), in large part, by putting faculty and students side by side.
But Franklin has a lot of space to fill yet at Crerar, so it still feels a little empty. Students from elsewhere on campus have seized on the common areas, formerly home to the library's stacks, as quiet study space. Some things in Hyde Park never change. "So our people are trying to be quiet, not wanting to disturb them. I want it to be a little louder in here," says Franklin, who has an easygoing nature and an irreverent streak to go along with his academic cred. Spark became the basis for Big Data software called the Berkeley data-analytics stack, which he and his fellow researchers dubbed BDAS and pronounced "bad ass." "This is about energy and collaboration."
He'll need both to get U of C where it wants to be.

Chicago's middle-aged rock star in Big Data; TransUnion is growing like a startup as demand for consumer data increases

TransUnion was doing Big Data before it was cool, and before it even had a name. Now it's building on its head start. The 50-year-old company, long synonymous with credit reports, has been on a tech-acquisition spree, buying companies and hiring workers at a breakneck pace, even by tech standards. Last year, TransUnion hired 350 tech-related workers, 233 of them in Chicago, where almost half of its 1,500-person headquarters staff is focused on technology or analytics.
It's hard to name a company in Chicago that's been hiring at such an aggressive clip in tech, except maybe legal-software maker Relativity, which added 225 tech jobs in the city last year, or Uptake, which went from zero to more than 800 employees in less than four years. Even so, TransUnion sneaked up on tech recruiters and others who fancy themselves in the know and who keep a close eye on which companies are on the rise.
Investors are keenly aware of the company, however. Its shares-the stock closed on May 24 at $68.48, near its all-time high-are up 25 percent for the year. That's three times the rise of the Nasdaq market and more than 12 times the S&P 500. The share price of rival credit-database Equifax is down 2 percent year to date.
For most of its life, TransUnion was owned by the Pritzker family's Marmon Group, which sold it to private-equity investors, including Madison Dearborn, in stages from 2010 to 2012. It went public in June 2015 at $22.50 a share.
Technology has been key to an overhaul by CEO James Peck, who was hired five years ago from LexisNexis. The company ditched its mainframes for an open-source platform that made it cheaper and easier to roll out products; they helped Peck double revenue to $1.93 billion last year, outpacing Equifax and Experian. "Previously they lagged their peers in growth and were not known as being at the front end of the innovation curve," says Tim McHugh, an analyst at William Blair in Chicago. "That's changed."
TransUnion innovated a decades-old product by offering customers a 30-month look at a consumer's financial history in real time, rather than a 30-day snapshot.
It's also benefiting from fortunate timing. TransUnion sits at the intersection of the old and new economies. The company historically provided information about consumers and their credit histories to credit card issuers and banks. Now a new group of consumer lenders, such as Chicago's Enova and Avant Technologies, are using data and algorithms to disrupt an old business. "We recognized this trend early and have an outsize share of that market," says Chris Cartwright, president of TransUnion's U.S. information services unit, its largest business.
Joe DeCosmo, chief analytics officer of Enova, says TransUnion is "more proactive than their peers. As our businesses grow, we use more data."
TRACKING EVERYTHING
TransUnion keeps track of everything from traffic violations to gym membership payments. "There's just been an explosion of information available in the marketplace," Cartwright says.
It has done 18 acquisitions in five years, including the $1.4 billion purchase of a British consumer credit bureau, Call Credit Information Group, announced in April, and two smaller deals in May. The company has branched into new businesses, such as providing data to health care providers, debt collectors and investors. It provides data for background checks to law enforcement and government customers. It's also the top credit information provider in India.
"The most comforting thing is there's not a single hot product," says Jeff Meuler, an analyst at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. "The long-term history of credit bureaus is it's tough to be the fastest-growing among them over the long term. Ten years ago, it was Experian; five years ago, it was Equifax. You can't rest on your laurels in this business."
The biggest threat, as illustrated by last year's data breach at Equifax that exposed the information of nearly 150 million consumers, is security. It was the major driver of TransUnion's hiring binge in 2017, which was 40 percent higher than the year before and remains intact. "It's an arms race," Cartwright says.
So is data science. The company has more than 300 data scientists, 125 of whom are at its headquarters in the West Loop, in the shadow of Willis Tower, across the street from Union Station. It needs more. Demand for these workers has exploded, from cryptocurrency to manufacturing, making it the hottest job in tech.
TransUnion recently funded a professorship in data science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "Part of the reason is to raise our profile," Cartwright says. "Chicago is an awesome source of talent, with UIC, Northwestern and University of Chicago. There's a lot of talent here, and these kids can go anywhere."
The company has information on more than 1 billion consumers, or more than 50 petabytes of data, a scale that few can claim. "If you're a data junkie, this is the sandbox you want to play in," Meuler says.

Facebook driving huge numbers to the polls

There's been a lot of consternation in recent months about Facebook's impact on politics. If it's not fears of partisan censorship and suppressed trending topics, it's worries about echo chambers or hyper-targeted campaign ads.
But in the upcoming presidential election, at least, Facebook's influence will lie somewhere else: The social network is driving huge numbers of people to the polls — and most of those people are likely to vote Democrat.
This effect is not at all by design. Instead, it's an accident of demographics. Facebook skews both young and female, which means the site's powerful get-out-the-vote campaigns reach more potential voters in the Hillary Clinton camp. The same could be said of Twitter, which over-indexes with people of color. Or Airbnb, which is popular among older, white adults — those statistically most likely to be Republican voters.
In the past week, dozens of technology companies have launched nonpartisan, apolitical voter registration drives, meant to increase civic participation on Election Day. But all could have potent political consequences, even if none of the companies frame them that way.
"Facebook can influence millions of votes by the literal press of a button," said Michael Brand, a professor of data science at Monash University in Australia. "Any decision it now makes regarding the political content of its pages ... is inherently politically loaded."
How loaded, of course, is a matter of conjecture — at least until after Election Day. Many technology companies, including Twitter and Uber, don't release any data on the number or types of voters reached by their campaigns. Other companies, such as the blogging platform Tumblr, report the number of times a get-out-the-vote campaign was shared (in Tumblr's case, 172,500), but not how many people actually registered as a result of it.
Facebook, on the other hand, is fairly unique: The social network has a long history of running voter registration and Election Day prompts, which means we have a good idea how well they work. The site has, for the past several years, displayed an "I Voted" button on Nov. 8, which allows users to notify their friends when they've voted and shows pictures of their friends who have voted already. Last weekend, Facebook also displayed a prominent News Feed banner encouraging users to register with their state board of elections.
In 2010, a team of researchers from the University of California at San Diego, working with Facebook's internal data science team, estimated that the site's "I Voted" button pushed an additional 340,000 voters to the polls. When Facebook added a publicly displayed organ donor option to profiles, organ donor registration rates increased 21-fold.
It's a pattern that seems to be repeating in this election, as well. While only a few states have released data about the registrations they've seen since Facebook began displaying a voting banner in News Feeds earlier this week, the numbers we do have are stunning. The reminder prompted 200,000 registrations in California, 30,000 in Indiana and 25,000 in Kentucky. Connecticut's voter applications increased tenfold over the previous week, and Minnesota saw 27,000 applications in a single day — the largest ever in the state's history.
"I applaud Facebook for joining our efforts to increase voter registration awareness in Georgia," reads a statement by Brian Kemp, the secretary of state of Georgia, where hits to the online voter registration system are up more than 2,000 percent. "I am encouraging all Facebook users to take action now and verify their registration status leading up to this year's historic election."
Kemp is a Republican; his party wouldn't benefit, in all likelihood, if "all Facebook users" heeded his call. Georgia's current active electorate skews white and Republican. Facebook's demographics, on the other hand, favor young people, people of color and women.
According to the Pew Research Center, 77 percent of female internet users are on Facebook, while only 66 percent of men are. Eighty-two percent of those ages 18 to 29 use the site, as do 75 percent of Hispanics.
That means that any efforts to encourage voter registration through Facebook will necessarily have an outsize impact on those communities, explained Katherine Haenschen, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who studies digital media and political participation. And while there's more variation here than some pundits would have us believe, those voting blocs generally come out for Democrats.
Haenschen stresses that this shouldn't be political: "It's not Facebook's fault if a candidate fails to be a credible choice for everyone," she said. And of course, people and politics are both fantastically complicated — perhaps Facebook's "voter megaphone" won't have the impact we expect. Brand points out that studies show Republican voters tend to be motivated by consensus, so maybe they'd be more persuaded by a social voting prompt than a Democratic voter would. Or maybe all these people will register, but they'll never show up to vote.
Experiments published in the Journal of Politics in 2015 found that while voter-registration drives do get people signed up, particularly in impoverished areas, they don't change the overall composition of the electorate. That's because, when Election Day rolls around, underrepresented voters — even if they're registered — still don't make it to the polls at the same rates as older, wealthier white people. They face larger structural and procedural obstacles that can't yet be addressed by Facebook.
Still, there's no doubt that Facebook will impact November's election: Its size and power guarantees it, if nothing else does. Brandon Naylor, the communications director for Democracy Works, a nonpartisan voting organization, says efforts like Facebook's are "making democracy more representative." The social network, together with Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, Foursquare and Lyft, has recently partnered with Democracy Works on its "Turbovote Challenge," an ambitious project that hopes to boost turnout to 80 percent by the 2020 presidential election.
"It's not beyond the realm of possibility," Naylor said. "Companies like Facebook have tremendous reach — we believe we're touching every eligible voter who did not turn out in the last election."

Huntley High student lauded for tech prowess

Where others see numbers and coding, Kyle Ockerlund sees hope for changing the world one program at a time.
The Huntley High School senior was among 10 Illinois high school students to receive the 2015 Fifty for the Future Award from the Illinois Technology Foundation earlier this year. The program, in its ninth year, recognized the top 60 Illinois technology students, including 50 college students and 10 high school students statewide.
Ockerlund has written two books on computer programming — "Jumpstart Ti Basic" and "Jumpstart Z80 Machine Code," both how-to guides for using programming languages with Texas Instruments graphing calculators — available through Amazon. He gained national attention for research the Experimental Science Society — which he helped found — completed on the effect school bell tone has on student concentration.
His research found a 10 percent decrease in concentration during tests among students exposed to the school's new higher-pitched bell sound compared to students exposed to the previous lower-pitched bell. After presenting his research to administrators, the bell tone was changed back to the low-pitch ring.
Since then, Ockerlund has been involved in other research studies, including a memory lab project examining how students memorize and retain information, more specifically languages.
"The goal is just to get a better understanding of how these things work so the whole process could be optimized for students learning languages," said Ockerlund, 17, of Lake in the Hills.
For two years, Ockerlund has undertaken an independent study in data science where he creates his own curriculum and teaches it to himself using online resources under the guidance of Huntley High computer science teacher Michelle Zietlow, who nominated him for the technology award.
"Last year, I built programs and trained an artificial neural network," he said. "It learned how to play tic-tac-toe all on its own."
Another project involves creating a routing program being used on a trial basis by the Cook County sheriff's office.
"It takes in addresses and creates a travel plan. That program is being used right now in order for them serving various papers and court orders," he said. "The plan is to eventually release it to the county and maybe other counties."
Zietlow said she is amazed by Ockerlund's creativity and motivation to learn about technology, which sets him apart from his peers.
"His understanding of machine learning is way beyond what I understand," she said. "He is just so ambitious and he picks up the material so quickly."
After graduating in May, Ockerlund aims to study data science, data mining and processing, and statistics.
"I could see myself working for a bank to make predictions on loan stability ... working for a hospital identifying cancerous cells in x-ray images," he said.

Sikich names a top 100 firm
NAPERVILLE — Sikich LLP, a professional services firm specializing in accounting, technology and advisory services, has been named a top 100 firm by Accounting Today. Sikich remained steady with a ranking of No. 31 on the 2016 list. Additionally, the firm has been named fourth largest in the Great Lakes region. Top 100 firms are ranked by U.S. revenues and are compiled by analyzing responses to "survey, analysis and growth strategies of firms." Accounting firms across North America complete an in-depth financial and operational survey, where trends are uncovered, growth and profitability metrics are highlighted, personnel levels are evaluated and much more. "Being recognized for this award is especially rewarding, as this prestigious national ranking represents the up and coming firms to watch," CEO Jim Sikich said. "Our dedicated professionals have once again demonstrated outstanding client service, resulting in the increase in top-line revenues and bottom line growth."
SCA partners in Maryland
DEERFIELD — Surgical Care Affiliates will partner with Surgery Center of Chevy Chase, bringing SCA's Maryland locations to six and aligning SCA with 24 more high-quality physicians. Surgery Center of Chevy Chase is a patient focused and physician-led outpatient surgery center. "This investment is part of a continued effort to identify and develop relationships with top tier physicians across Maryland and provide patients with high-quality surgical care at a significantly lower cost." said Tim Buono, group vice president of development for SCA.
COD offers data program
GLEN ELLYN — The new Foundations of Data Science certificate program at College of DuPage prepares students for careers in data analysis fields while providing cross-training for employees who want a sought-after skills set. Recently approved by the Illinois Community College Board, the certificate provides a point of entry into a relatively new field while helping existing employees sharpen skills in data collection, research methods, basic statistics, exploratory data analysis, data visualization and data mining. Christine Monnier, professor of sociology at College of DuPage, said much of data science relates to human behavior, which is why three of the required courses for the 13-credit hour certificate are in sociology. She said that most existing certificates in this field are specialized or require prerequisites, while the few general certificate programs focus on technical aspects. Visit cod.edu/programs/sociology, email monnier@cod.edu or call (630) 942-2438.
Bank executive to retire
GENEVA — Robert (Bob) Kerbs set to retire from The State Bank of Geneva after 21 years of service with an overall 42 years of banking experience. Kerbs began working for The State Bank of Geneva in May 1995 as a loan officer and in December 2001 was promoted to vice president of lending. Kerbs has handled many roles during his years at the bank including security, audit committee, executive loan committee — and even the grill master during client appreciations events.

It started as the Tech 25 but quickly grew into the Tech 50. Each year since 2011, we've put the spotlight on a mostly new list of names you need to know if you care about Chicago tech-nearly 400 of them. For the 10th edition, we've revisited our previous lists with an eye toward those who made lasting impacts and remain in the game. It's largely an all-star list, but there are some new faces, as well, because it wouldn't be the Tech 50 without a few surprises.
GODARD ABEL Co-founder, CEO, G2 Crowd
Abel, 49, is working on a trifecta. After selling sales-software companies BigMachines to Oracle for about $400 million and SteelBrick to Salesforce for $300 million, he's building two more startups. G2 Crowd, an online-review site for business software, has raised $100 million. And he's executive chairman of ThreeKit, a software company that makes tools for retailers to creating 3D product images for e-commerce.
Who knew? He's fast on land and water. Before he became a marathoner, Abel rowed crew at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
CHARLES BROOKS Chief information officer, Kemper
Brooks, 53, runs IT for Chicago-based Kemper, where he's leading an effort to untangle more than two dozen legacy systems in the company's core property-casualty business. He's also moving software applications to the cloud. The result: Reliability is on the rise and costs are down. The former Accenture partner previously worked at ACE Group, Aetna and Travelers.
Who knew? He's an avid snowboarder.
BOBBIE BYRNE Doctor, chief information officer, Advocate Aurora Health
Byrne, 52, is a pediatrician who developed her tech savvy the old-fashioned way: out of frustration. Medicine was one of the last bastions of paper. She became an early adopter of computers, which led her to become a consultant and then to move to an executive job at medical software maker Eclypsis before coming back to hospitals. She's leading Advocate Aurora, one of the country's largest hospital systems, through an overhaul of its medical-records system.
Who knew? Her 22-year-old triplets just graduated from Northwestern University.
SONA CHAWLA Chief growth and innovation officer, CDW
Chawla, 53, was head of e-commerce at Walgreens, where she launched one of the most successful apps in retail. Her marketing savvy led her to the No. 2 job at Kohl's before computer seller CDW came calling last year. It should be familiar territory: Chawla was vice president of Dell's global online business before joining Walgreens.
Who knew? Her first job was at Bob's Big Boy Restaurant.
SACH CHITNIS Co-founder, managing partner, Jump Capital
Chitnis, 44, and partner Mike McMahon bet that Chicago didn't have enough venture capital and that there was a shortage of $5 million to $10 million checks. The founders of Jump Trading thought so, too, and the venture firm launched in 2012. Jump has raised several funds since then, including $200 million last year. Among Jump's investments are two data-science companies that spun out of Northwestern University, 4C Insights and Narrative Science.
Who knew? He had perfect attendance in grade school.
SEAN CHOU Co-founder, CEO, Catalytic
Chou, 48, made his mark as chief technology officer at Fieldglass, architecting its software. After the company sold to SAP for $1 billion, he made the leap to CEO, starting Catalytic, an artificial-intelligence software company that aims to make automating mundane tasks easy enough for nontech users. Chip maker Intel led a $30 million investment in the company in 2019.
Who knew? He's a former Marine who earned a psychology degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1995.
BRANDON CRUZ Co-founder, co-chairman, GoHealth
Along with former college roommate Clint Jones, Cruz, 42, sold GoHealth last summer for $1.3 billion in one of the biggest deals in Chicago tech. For an encore, they're planning to take the company public. Starting in 2001, the duo built GoHealth from a tech provider to health insurance brokers to a marketplace for comparing and buying insurance, deftly surfing from Obamacare to an even bigger wave, retiring baby boomers joining the Medicare rolls.
Who knew? In the early days of GoHealth, Cruz had a side hustle as a kitesurfing instructor.
JIM DUGAN Founding managing partner, OCA Ventures
OCA Ventures was one of the earliest venture-capital funds investing in Chicago tech companies and traces its roots to options trading firm O'Connor & Associates. The 50-year-old's best-known win was an early bet on Cleversafe, the data-storage company bought by IBM for $1.3 billion in 2015. It also came up a winner on Cartavi. More recent deals include the Mom Project, Logic Gate, Regroup Therapy and SpotHero.
Who knew? He makes a fine Roman pasta carbonara.
JENNY FARVER Chief technology officer
Farver, 43, made a name for herself as chief technology officer during stints at Lightstream and Popular Pays. She previously led the engineering team at Civis Analytics. Farver also taught data analytics at Northwestern University.
Who knew? She's an avid gardener who also forages in her backyard.
BRIAN FITZPATRICK Co-founder, CTO, Tock
Known simply as Fitz, he's one of the top coders in Chicago, who started building Google's engineering team here. When the coronavirus paralyzed the restaurant industry, he and his team built an online-ordering system for Tock's customers in less than one week. Fitzpatrick, 49, might be best known for launching ORD Camp, an annual invite-only Chicago gathering of some of the brightest people from tech and beyond.
Who knew? He's an amateur potter.
AMY FRANCETIC Founder, managing general partner, Buoyant Ventures

She's now raising her own fund aimed at digital climate solutions.
Who knew? She ran track at Stanford University and later worked at Stanford Research Institute with a team that created the technology that was the basis for Siri.
STEVEN GALANIS Co-founder, CEO, Cameo
The spotlight is on Galanis, 32, as leader of Cameo, the startup that's generating the most buzz in Chicago. Founded on the idea of getting sports stars and other celebrities to film video shoutouts for regular folks willing to shell out a little cash, Cameo hardly seemed destined to become an "it" company. Then legendary venture firm Kleiner Perkins stepped in to lead a $50 million investment in the company. Now Galanis has to prove Cameo isn't a one-hit wonder. A new Zoom-call product called Cameo Live looks promising.
Who knew? His family has been in the photography business, Furla Studio, since 1945.
MIKE GAMSON CEO, Relativity
Gamson, 46, is one of Chicago's top operators and most active startup investors. He joined LinkedIn in 2007, opening a Chicago office that now has more than 750 people, eventually rising to one of the company's top executive jobs.

One of the most sought-after investors and mentors, he has actively backed female entrepreneurs and founders of color. Recent investments include Rheaply, Five to Nine and Landscape Hub.
Who knew? The Highland Park native ran a burrito restaurant and surf shop in Costa Rica after college.
CARLTON GATES Director of technical recruiting, Pizza Hut Connect
Gates, 44, is a rock-star tech recruiter who honed his skills at Oracle and Google before coming to Chicago two years ago. He helped recruit Oracle's cloud computing team and land senior tech talent at Google's primary ad business. Gates helped Keeper Security tackle a major growth spurt before heading up tech recruiting for the Chicago-based digital division of Pizza Hut.
Who knew? He's an adrenaline junkie who has run with bulls in Pamplona and bungee jumped.
CHRIS GLADWIN CEO, Ocient
Gladwin, 56, joined the ranks of star tech founders in 2015, when IBM paid more than $1.3 billion for the data-storage company he started 11 years earlier. But Gladwin, a hard-core runner and cyclist, didn't sit still. The serial entrepreneur soon launched Ocient, a software company that aims to tame the biggest of Big Data. The company recently raised $15 million.
Who knew? A former yoga teacher, Gladwin's latest venture is the Forge, an outdoor adventure park in Lemont.
RON GUERRIER Chief information officer, State of Illinois
IT jobs are hard. Government IT jobs are really hard. Then there's the state of Illinois, which was behind on a $350 million tech upgrade when Guerrier, 45, was hired from the private sector to take over an agency with more than 2,000 employees and contractors. Ninety percent of the state's finance systems are finally on a single platform. Next up is human resources.
Who knew? He once worked as a repo man in Chicago.

Who knew? He's sailed the Race to Mackinac 28 times.
JUSTYN HOWARD Co-founder, CEO, Sprout Social
A rookie founder, Howard, 41, bet big that social media would become crucial to how companies communicate with their customers and employees. After launching in 2010, Sprout Social attracted a stable of high-profile investors, including Lightbank, NEA and Goldman Sachs en route to an IPO last year. The stock is up 64 percent since then.
Who knew? He traded his dirt bike for his first computer and learned to program with a book from the public library.
LINDA JOJO Chief digital officer, United Airlines
Jojo, 55, came to United just as the merger with Continental was being completed. That's when her team really got to work. They put smartphones and iPads in the hands of front-line workers, overhauled the airline's mobile app and built a data-analytics platform that combines operations and customer information in real time.
Who knew? The COVID-19 outbreak prompted her to grow tomatoes, eggplant and peppers from seed.
CLINT JONES Co-founder, CEO, GoHealth
Jones, 43, along with former college roommate Brandon Cruz, pulled off one of the biggest deals in Chicago tech when they sold GoHealth last summer for $1.3 billion. Now they're planning to take the company public. Starting in 2001, the two built GoHealth from a tech provider to health insurance brokers to a marketplace for comparing and buying insurance, shifting from Obamacare to retiring baby boomers joining the Medicare rolls.
Who knew? Jones loves to do anything on the water. He's currently working on his wakesurfing skills.
DAVID KALT Founder, Reverb.com
After OptionsXpress went public and sold for $1 billion, co-founder David Kalt, 53, bought a guitar shop.

It's unlikely to be Kalt's last act as an entrepreneur.
Who knew? He has more fedoras than guitars. He also does Pilates better than he plays guitar.
STEVEN KAPLAN Professor of entrepreneurship and finance, University of Chicago
The 60-year-old launched the entrepreneurship program at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and started its business-plan competition, the New Venture Challenge, in 1996. Since then more than 4,000 students and 800 companies have gone through the NVC course and two offshoots. Two of Chicago's most successful tech companies, Grubhub and Braintree, trace their roots to the program.
Who knew? He memorizes the names and faces of all 205 students before they arrive for class in the fall.
BRAD KEYWELL Founder, CEO, Uptake
Keywell's business partnership with Eric Lefkofsky dates back to the dot-com boom. They took three Chicago tech companies public between 2006 and 2011. Their venture-capital fund, Lightbank, was the fourth most active startup investor in Chicago during the past 10 years, according to PitchBook. All eyes are on Keywell, 50, to see if he can keep the streak going with Uptake, a data-analytics company that soared to more than 800 employees in 2017 before rapidly scaling back.
Who knew? He was a silver medalist in table tennis at the 1984 North American Youth Maccabi Games.
AMANDA LANNERT CEO, Jellyvision
Lannert, 46, became CEO of one of Chicago's most enduring tech companies in 2011 after guiding Jellyvision's pivot from games (You Don't Know Jack) to advertising services to an HR software maker, where it hit its stride, lining up Fortune 500 companies as customers. Lannert is an active startup investor and mentor, on her own and through Hyde Park Angels.

She left Sidley Austin in 2002 to become general counsel at CDW, where she later led the company's international expansion on her way to the corner office in 2019. Few tech companies can match CDW when it comes to gender equality. Six of 13 executive officers are women.

ERIC LEFKOFSKY Founder, CEO, Tempus Labs
One of Chicago's most prolific tech entrepreneurs, Lefkofsky's credits include public companies Groupon, InnerWorkings and Echo Global Logistics.

Who knew? McCall was a nationally ranked squash player.
CHAD MIRKIN Chemistry professor, researcher, Northwestern University
Mirkin's work in nanotech is all about small, microscopic things. But he's had a big impact. The 56-year-old's lab at Northwestern has spun out seven companies. Among them are Exicure, a gene-therapy company, and Azul 3D, a 3D-printing startup.
Who knew? He started out in medicine but hated it and has been in the lab ever since.
SEAN NOLAN Former CEO, AveXis

J.B. PRITZKER Governor, State of Illinois
Before he became governor, Pritzker, 55, was a venture capitalist who was the loudest cheerleader for Chicago tech.

Who knew? He launched his first venture fund, New World Ventures, in 1996.
PENNY PRITZKER Chairman, PSP Partners

He's been busy, combining IT systems that come with mergers, then migrating the company's IT platform from its own computer systems to the cloud.

BRENDA DARDEN WILKERSON CEO, AnitaB.org
It's hard to find a better role model for AnitaB.org's mission to get more girls involved in computing than Darden Wilkerson, 60. She earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from Northwestern University in 1998 and went on to lead the computer science program at Chicago Public Schools before being selected to run AnitaB.org. The nonprofit puts on the Grace Hopper Celebration, a massive annual conference for women in computing, which will go virtual this year for its 20th anniversary.
Who knew? She wanted to be a doctor but fell in love with coding courses required for premed.
SAM YAGAN CEO, ShopRunner
After founding and selling two startups, Yagan, 43, broadened his résumé to include running other people's companies, including Match.com. When he was hired in 2016 as CEO of ShopRunner, which provides e-commerce services to retailers such as Bloomingdale's and Jimmy Choo, Yagan moved the company to Chicago. He co-founded startup accelerator Excelerate Labs, which became Techstars Chicago, and launched a venture fund, Corazon Capital, with Steve Farsht.
Who knew? He's got game. Yagan made it to the Illinois High School Association's three-point showdown in 1995 when he played for the Illinois Mathematics & Science Academy.
BETSY ZIEGLER CEO, 1871
Ziegler, 49, is putting her stamp on version 3.0 of 1871, quietly extending the reach of the city's most high-profile tech incubator.

A few weeks ago, a contingent of Motorola Solutions' senior executives flew to Silicon Valley to get a look at the latest and greatest technology by meeting some of the world's top venture funds and their startups. It's the sort of journey Motorola's in-house venture-capital fund used to make by itself. But these days, the company's chief technology and information officers, as well as the heads of software and innovation and strategy, also are hitting the road.
The field trip says a lot about what lies ahead for the Chicago-based maker of police radios and dispatch equipment. Two years after Motorola borrowed $1 billion from private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners for a stock buyback, the rest of CEO Greg Brown's strategy is taking shape. Through technology acquisitions, investments and partnerships, he's trying to prepare Motorola as it faces what could be the biggest disruption to its business since the company started selling police radios nearly 90 years ago.
The rise of the smartphone-which changed how we communicate, shop, entertain ourselves and get from here to there-is coming to the emergency dispatch center. AT&T was just awarded a contract by the U.S. Department of Commerce to build out FirstNet, a wireless phone network devoted to public safety. The idea dates to the 9/11 attacks, but work is only now beginning. The transition might take five years or as long as two decades. The expected initial impact on Motorola ranges from a blip to an existential threat. But no matter the exact changeover, Motorola needs to adjust.
"The point is, the industry is changing," says Eduardo Conrado, chief strategy and innovation officer. To keep up, "you can either partner, buy or build. We're using all three levers."
GETTING READY
Since 2015, Motorola has spent about $1.5 billion buying or investing in tech companies, up from about $100 million altogether between 2011 and 2014. It snapped up Airwave in the United Kingdom last year for $1 billion and in March purchased Interexport in Chile for $147 million to boost its services business. The company now gets 43 percent of revenue from services, up from 36 percent two years ago.
Services aren't as profitable as selling radios, but acquisitions have helped push revenue growth to the mid-single-digit range that Brown promised when Motorola Solutions spun off its mobile phone business six years ago.
Motorola also is buying technology, such as dispatch software maker Spillman Technologies of Salt Lake City; push-to-talk software firm Kodiak Networks of Plano, Texas; and Australian productivity-app maker Gridstone. It has stepped up its venture funding as well, leading investments in companies such as Boston-based Neurala, which makes artificial intelligence for video, and Nok Nok Labs in Palo Alto, Calif., which makes security-authentication software for mobile devices.
Motorola also has partnered with several startups to offer new capabilities to customers. Locally, it invested $4 million in DevMynd, a contract software shop. "Ten years ago, we would have built it all in-house," Conrado says.
But Motorola has beefed up its internal software capabilities, too, even as it cut about 400 jobs in the Chicago area in the past two years. Local headcount is about 3,100, and the company moved its headquarters out of Schaumburg to attract hard-to-find young software developers. It now has more than 200 software engineers and other tech workers doing R&D downtown. In April, it hired its first head of software, Andrew Sinclair, from Microsoft. It added its first head of data science, Dan Law, in early 2016 and today employs a dozen data scientists in Chicago and others in Israel, where it recently launched a startup incubator.
"The big change in the past three years for our technology organization has been moving from telecom to digital, with more focus on software, cloud and data science," Conrado says.
Motorola is betting on a future in which public safety agencies want emergency radios supplemented by smartphones and other devices that will provide data, video, mapping and other features. "We feel like (they) are going to coexist," Conrado says of traditional radio and the smartphone network technology called LTE. The question is for how long? The answers from analysts vary widely.
"We continue to believe that LTE/FirstNet is likely to be a meaningful net negative for Motorola's business as voice (communication) transitions to LTE over time," Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Spinola recently advised clients. "We haven't seen it yet in the numbers. We still believe that we will." He rates Motorola "underperform" with a $63 share price target versus $85.48 on Sept. 15. The stock hit $92.21 on July 27, the highest level since Brown broke up the company in 2011.
On the other hand, Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James who rates Motorola "outperform" with a $100 price target, sees a less imminent threat. "These guys all have LTE phones already," he says of police and firefighters. "I don't see FirstNet doing anything new. It will be a market shift from Verizon to AT&T."
A PIECE OF THE ACTION
Motorola will get some of the $6.5 billion about to be spent on FirstNet because AT&T is relying heavily on Motorola's sales force to sign up emergency services agencies. It also is providing push-to-talk software, which would allow phones on FirstNet to communicate with traditional radios.
In the meantime, Conrado says, customers will have to upgrade their 911 dispatch centers to better handle mobile phones to provide location and other data. "When 911 was introduced, it was set up with home phones in mind. Now 80 percent of the calls come from mobile." Conrado also thinks more customers will pay Motorola to run their call centers.
But that might not be enough of a firewall at a company that is estimated to get half its revenue from the U.S. radio business. "If LTE cannibalizes their business, services isn't going to save them," McCourt says, though the company has time to reorient itself. "I don't think it's something Motorola worries about in the next five years."
Motorola and its shareholders can only hope he's right.

To reach climate goal, Monsanto needs help from customers

It's obvious where David Moose's property line ends and the neighboring farm field begins.
Moose's field has a light brown hue, coated by the dead cereal rye and corn cobs that remain from the cover crop he planted in October. Across his property line, the traditionally tilled earth is a darker brown, uncolored by cover crops.
"Cover crops, they've been kind of the buzzword for the last five to six years," said Moose, who farms corn and soybeans on about 1,500 acres south of Springfield, Ill.
Moose, whose family has been farming for generations, stopped using traditional tilling methods when he began taking over a larger role in farm operations from his father 32 years ago.
In the last several years, he's added cover crops to further stabilize the soil, help build up even more organic matter and control weeds. Now, he's trying to reduce the amount of fertilizer he uses by applying it in the spring rather than the fall so that the new crop can better absorb it.
It's these types of practices agricultural products giant Monsanto is trying to refine and promote among farmers, because if it wants to live up to its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2021, it will need a lot of help from its customers.
The Creve Coeur-based company can only do so much in house to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions. It will apply best farming practices to its own seed production. But that only accounts for about one-sixth of its carbon emissions.
The majority of Monsanto's emissions, about two-thirds, come from the production of its signature Roundup herbicide, said Michael Lohuis, who heads Monsanto's agricultural environmental strategy. Those factory emissions will be difficult to reduce completely, so the company is looking for carbon offsets from farmers.
But all these practices and their associated environmental benefits and global warming offsets have to be studied and quantified to prove their worth.
More than that, they have to make business sense for farmers. In order to get farmers to reduce their carbon footprint (agriculture makes up about 9 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and about 24 percent of global emissions), Monsanto will have to figure out both sides of that equation.
"None of this happens unless farmers buy into this," Lohuis said. "It needs to make sense for them practically and economically."
Luckily, there do seem to be economic benefits to farmers in some instances. Tillage, for instance, decreases soil carbon sequestration and requires more trips across the rows with farm equipment. Using less tillage can help build up carbon in soils.
But cutting carbon isn't why Moose adopted no-till. While traditional tillage helps fields dry out faster, making it easier for farmers to plant earlier in the year after heavy rains, it also makes the soil more prone to erosion, and Moose wanted to keep wind and rain from carrying off any more of his family's soil.
"Mother Nature only gave us so much soil to work with," he said. "Everything we lose with wind or water erosion, we're likely not going to get back."
He admits it took some time before he started seeing noticeable benefits, and no-till does tend to require more management and patience. But he wants his son to eventually take over the operation, and he was willing to wait for his investment in the soil to pay off.
"It took about five years for the soil to come around," Moose said. "The soil gets hard initially, but once the earthworms and bacteria and fungi get stabilized, they tend to loosen the soil up."
Even more than tillage, fertilizer applications account for a large share of cropland greenhouse gas emissions, which mostly come in the form of nitrous oxide emissions.
The nitrogen content of fertilizer adds to what is eventually released back as nitrous oxide, a gas with about 300 times more warming potential than carbon dioxide. Some 80 percent of U.S. nitrous oxide emissions come from agricultural soil management, which makes up about 4 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
There, Monsanto hopes its growing data science and precision agriculture arm can help refine fertilizer application to reduce the total amount. In some instances, cover crops can also help capture nitrogen and keep it in the soil for plant use longer term.
Both practices also hold the potential to benefit Monsanto. More farmers could use its precision agriculture and farming data services to reduce nitrogen inputs, and no-till farming tends to require more herbicides such as Roundup.
Nicholas Goeser, director of the Soil Health Partnership, points to benefits for farmers, too, including better yields over time, better drought resilience and less nutrient runoff. The organization receives part of its funding from the National Corn Growers Association and Monsanto, but also works with environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Nature Conservancy.
The Soil Health Partnership is working to quantify and study the effects of some of the techniques. It partners with farmers like Moose to gather data and publish research.
"These other tangential benefits can really help crop productivity outside of the climate side," Goeser said.
The prospect of carbon regulations could even be an opportunity for farmers who can sequester it, Goeser said.
"Farmers are very interested in it and they're very aware of mounting environmental pressures," he said. "But there are also opportunities that exist in carbon sequestration and carbon markets to gain additional value from their land."
But some of the changes require a culture shift and are harder to adopt on larger operations, said Lee Curby, who farms near Moose and was trying to learn some of his fertilizer reduction techniques.
Applying nitrogen fertilizer in the fall, when farmers are not busy with the spring planting season, is easier than applying it in the spring as Moose has done, Curby said.
"If you get to be much bigger than we are, it comes back to the management aspect," he said.
Many farmers work on one year or multiyear leases and aren't willing to wait for the investment in soil to pay off. Moose doesn't see many other farmers making the switch until they're required to by regulations - either on nutrient runoff in water or agriculture carbon limits. He feels his farm will be ready, whenever they do.
"I will easily be in compliance," he said.
Monsanto's Lohuis says climate change will ultimately hurt its customers through drought and unpredictable weather, which means they will buy less of its seeds and herbicides. But it, too, has its eyes on the prospect of future regulation.
"If we do the right thing and we lead and produce the right solution, it takes away the need for regulation," Lohuis said.

CARBON CONCERNS
Conventional tillage • The disturbed earth dries faster, allowing for planting earlier in the season, but it allows more greenhouse gases and water to escape.
No-till farming • Farmers do not disturb the soil except when planting. Plant residue left covering the soil helps capture gases and reduces evaporation and soil erosion.
Fertilizer • Monsanto's biggest concern is the greenhouse gases generated by fertilizer. Leveraging precision planting and data science will cut the amount of fertilizer used.

AI trader? Tech vet launches hedge fund run by artificial intelligence
Chicago Daily Herald
February 19, 2017 Sunday

Babak Hodjat believes humans are too emotional for the stock market. So he's started one of the first hedge funds run completely by artificial intelligence.
"Humans have bias and sensitivities, conscious and unconscious," says Hodjat, a computer scientist who helped lay the groundwork for Apple's Siri. "It's well documented we humans make mistakes. For me, it's scarier to be relying on those human-based intuitions and justifications than relying on purely what the data and statistics are telling you."
Hodjat, with 21 patents to his name, is co-founder and top scientist of Sentient Technologies Inc., a startup that has spent nearly a decade-largely in secret-training an AI system that can scour billions of pieces of data, spot trends, adapt as it learns and make money trading stocks.
The team of technology-industry vets is betting that software responsible for teaching computers to drive cars, beat the world's best poker players and translate languages will give their hedge fund an edge on Wall Street pros.
The walls of Sentient's San Francisco office are dotted with posters for robots-come-alive movies such as "Terminator." Inside a small windowless trading room, the only light emanates from computer screens and a virtual fire on a big-screen TV. Two guys are quietly monitoring the machine's trades-just in case the system needs to be shut down.
"If all hell breaks loose," Hodjat says, "there is a red button."
Sentient won't disclose its performance or many details about the technology, and the jury is out on the wisdom of handing off trading to a machine. While traditional hedge funds including Bridgewater Associates, Point72 and Renaissance Technologies have poured money into advanced technology, many use artificial intelligence to generate ideas-not to control their entire trading operations.
All the same, Sentient, which currently trades only its own money, is being closely watched by the finance and AI communities. The venture capital firm owned by Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, and India's biggest conglomerate, Tata Group, are among backers who have given the company $143 million. (Beyond trading, Sentient's AI system is being applied to a separate e-commerce product.)
Trading is "one of the top 10 places that AI can make a difference," says Nello Cristianini, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Bristol who has been advising Sentient. "A trading algorithm can look at the data, make a decision, act and repeat-you can have full autonomy."
Sentient's team includes veterans of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other technology companies. They're part of a small group in Silicon Valley using expertise in data science and the field of artificial intelligence known as machine learning to try and disrupt financial markets.
AI scientists typically have no interest in working for a hedge fund, says Richard Craib, who started the AI hedge fund Numerai. "But they may want to mess around with data sets." Numerai's system makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymous contributors who participate in a weekly tournament where prizes are awarded in Bitcoin.
It recently raised $6 million from investors including Howard Morgan, the co-founder of the quant investment management firm Renaissance Technologies. "It's entirely a data science problem," Craib says.
Another company, called Emma, started a hedge fund last year based on an artificial intelligence system that can write news articles.
Hodjat of Sentient spent much of his career focused on the language-detection technology behind smartphone digital assistants. Several employees from his previous company, Dejima, went on to create Apple's Siri. Rather than join, he chose to focus on advances in artificial intelligence. His career goals didn't include finance, but he sees markets as one of the most promising applications for the technology. The vast amounts of publicly available data, along with stronger computers to analyze it for patterns, make the field an ideal fit. "That is the fuel for AI," he says.
Sentient's system is inspired by evolution. According to patents, Sentient has thousands of machines running simultaneously around the world, algorithmically creating what are essentially trillions of virtual traders that it calls "genes."
These genes are tested by giving them hypothetical sums of money to trade in simulated situations created from historical data. The genes that are unsuccessful die off, while those that make money are spliced together with others to create the next generation. Thanks to increases in computing power, Sentient can squeeze 1,800 simulated trading days into a few minutes.
An acceptable trading gene takes a few days and then is used in live trading. Employees set goals such as returns to achieve, risk level and time horizon, and then let the machines go to work. The AI system evolves autonomously as it gains more experiences.
Sentient typically owns a wide-ranging batch of U.S. stocks, trading hundreds of times per day and holding positions for days or weeks. "We didn't impose that on the system," says Jeff Holman, the company's chief investment officer. "The artificial intelligence seems to agree with what you get from human intelligence that it's better to spread your bets and have a more diversified portfolio."
As impressive as Sentient's technology appears, it's hard to know if it works. The company says the AI system is beating internal benchmarks, but won't disclose what those are. It shares little about the data used for the AI's decision-making and isn't profitable. The company plans to bring in outside investors later this year. Holman, a Wall Street veteran who joined last year, said the company is limited on what it can say by U.S. Securities Exchange Commission rules restricting marketing by hedge funds that are raising money. "The platform is solid," he says. "It doesn't look like any other strategy I've seen."
Anthony Ledford, the chief scientist at the $19 billion hedge fund Man AHL in London, warns of putting too much faith in this branch of artificial intelligence without more evidence. Man AHL uses machine learning for a portion of its clients money, and Ledford is encouraged by the results. While the company is exploring a stand-alone machine-learning strategy, he says it's too early to declare success. "There's a lot of hype and promise," Ledford says. "But when you actually ask people how many hundreds of millions dollars they are trading, many of them don't come back with much at all."
Little performance data is available about AI-focused hedge funds. One index that tracks 12 pools that utilize AI as part of its core strategies, called Eurekahedge AI Hedge Fund Index, returned 5 percent last year. That's slightly better than the average hedge fund, but trailed the S&P 500.
Tristan Fletcher, who wrote his doctoral thesis on machine learning in financial markets and works for a hedge fund, says investors may be reluctant to turn over their money completely to a machine. "I know how conservative investors are and I know of no one who would put their money in a system that's fully systematic," says Fletcher. "Machine learning isn't a panacea for everything. You need people who have literal thinking."
Chen Chen worked for Sentient until 2012 as an analyst. In August 2011, while the company was still known as Genetic Finance and operating in secret, the system was trading when Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating for the first time, sending markets into turmoil. Chen, now a trader in Hong Kong, went back to review the system's performance for the day and saw it had outperformed the market and made money. He notes that there was no precedent for a U.S. downgrade and wonders how Sentient's AI system made its decisions. "That was a big surprise," he says.

Chris Tang has taken the term homework to a happy extreme. During his time at Glenbrook South High School, Tang was a member of the school's service-oriented activities, Interact and Key Club, but "never really a leader," he said. "I just participated now and then," he said. 
Since graduating, though, he's kicked his service commitment into overdrive with an initiative he calls "Memory Meals," sparked by the COVID-19 crisis. He's invited people to create packaged breakfasts and drop them off at his house or to pledge money he'll use to make meals for distribution to social service agencies. In a document he sent to fellow members of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020, Tang noted that a breakfast costs all of $1.50 to create. The "meals" part is obvious; "memory" relates to the positive feeling of helping others — "creating this memory for themselves and making a difference," he said. "I think just having all that time in quarantine and hearing all those stories about the struggles people are having, it just felt right, I guess, to create Memory Meals and to support them," Tang said. The Memory Meals effort last month targeted Housing Forward, a Maywood-based nonprofit. Its mission is to transition people in 21 west Cook County communities from "housing crisis to housing stability," according to its website. Tang, with his brothers Ivan and Nathan, has dropped off a week's worth of bagged meals there each Saturday for the past month. This month and in August, his service shifts to Rogers Park. He will be working with the faith-based UR Chicago Alliance and is exploring relationships with other organizations such as the Howard Area Community Center. As of June 29, Memory Meals had packed and donated more than 800 meals. Tang's goal over the summer is 2,020, in honor of Glenbrook South's Class of 2020. "I'd like to thank those that donated to Memory Meals, because their generosity is much appreciated by those who've received it," he said. To participate in Memory Meals, Tang asks people to contact him through email at ctang500@gmail.com or by sending a text message to (847) 736-9456. A Titans boys tennis co-captain whose senior season was canceled by COVID-19, Tang hopes to continue playing club or intramural tennis at Purdue University, where he plans to study computer science and data science. His departure to West Lafayette may not be the end of Memory Meals. "Once I leave I might pitch it to some of the clubs at Glenbrook South, like Interact or Key Club," Tang said. "Just giving it legs to new people and seeing if they want to continue. Nothing's set in stone yet, but I would definitely like for it to become a normal thing, where we continue to support those who need it."

A ‘Great' suburban workplace WESTCHESTER — Automotive sales platform company IAA Inc. has been recognized as a Great Place to Work in the U.S., as well as one of the 2020 Best Workplaces in Chicago. The Great Place to Work certification platform uses data science to quantify the current state of a corporate workplace culture and compares it to the best in the world. 
IAA's certification is based on over one-third of IAA U.S. employees completing an anonymous GPTW survey, which considered various aspects of the IAA work environment and culture, including metrics such as employee satisfaction, benefits and opportunities. "More than 90 percent of the IAA team believes their work directly aligns with the company's mission, reinforcing our combined dedication to organizational clarity and our focus on creating a positive working environment and culture. It is an honor to work alongside such a strong and devoted team each and every day," said John Kett, CEO and president of IAA.

Terms of the lease were not announced. Ryan Earley, vice president, with Jeff Galante and Terry Grapenthin, principals at Lee &amp; Associates' Illinois office in Rosemont, represented the tenant, Savoye North America. The owner, Link Industrial Properties, was represented by Transwestern. American Way building sold LIBERTYVILLE — SVN | Chicago Commercial said the American Way Corporate medical office building complex at 1232-1280 American Way in Libertyville has been sold for an undisclosed sum. Albert Lindeman and Nathalie Fisher of SVN | Chicago Commercial represented the out-of-state buyer working closely with them for more than six months. The campuslike setting provided ideal for their existing portfolio. The buyer was motivated to purchase the complex due to the current medical tenant mix occupying the building. "Demand for quality construction with quality tenants are still a high priority," said Lindeman.

In move to reopen, counties in St. Louis area take varying paths

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson earlier this week released a blueprint for reopening the state amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Since then, two St. Louis-area counties have said they will follow suit, and two others have said they will stick with plans to shelter in place. The mayor of Eureka, in St. Louis County, said his city will defy the county's order to stay closed.
And on Wednesday, the head of the Missouri Gaming Commission said the state's 13 casinos might not open until May 15 or later, in part because of conflicting rules across jurisdictions in the state.
The piecemeal reopening is emblematic of differing opinions on how to deal with the virus across sectors including politics, science, business and health.
Franklin County, where there have been 112 cases and 13 deaths, was the first in the St. Louis area to announce a relaxation of the rules, starting last Saturday, even before Parson's changes went into effect. Most of the county's reported cases are in one nursing home.
"The numbers (of coronavirus cases) simply cannot justify what is impacting everybody's lives right now," Franklin County Presiding Commissioner Tim Brinker said.
But state rules still in place limiting the size of gatherings blunted the immediate effect.
On Tuesday, the executives for Jefferson and St. Charles counties announced they will follow Parson.
All three have infection rates less than half of those in St. Louis city and county, and officials have said that their case count is lower outside of hot spots in long-term care facilities.
Among the White House specifications that must be met for a state to reopen is a "downward trajectory" of cases. The guidelines can be modified for rural or suburban areas that have suffered more mild outbreaks, however.
A 14-day rolling average of new cases in Jefferson County, prepared by the Post-Dispatch using state data, does not show a decreasing trend. But state data often lags county data, and the number of new cases in that county is often in the single digits.
Jefferson County reports a total of 273 positive cases, including six more new cases Wednesday, and four deaths. Officials say 105 cases are linked to long-term care facilities, but that total includes some workers from outside the county who aren't included in the 273-person total.
A county health department spokeswoman did not respond Wednesday to emailed questions about the statistics.
At a St. Charles County Council meeting Monday, County Executive Steve Ehlmann presented data showing a downward trend in new cases, using a rolling 14-day average.
The county's peak occurred April 12, the data show. The county has traced the close contacts of those who have tested positive for the virus since the first known case appeared March 18, according to the presentation.
Ehlmann has stressed that businesses in St. Charles County were never ordered to shut down. Residents and businesses were allowed to determine what activities were essential.
St. Louis County has reported 3,060 cases and 159 deaths, and St. Louis has had 1,126 cases and 60 deaths.
St. Charles County has 596 reported cases and 34 deaths.
Another pillar for reopening, according to health officials, is the availability of widespread testing, but those numbers are hard to come by on a county level. Private labs don't report their testing statistics to local officials, and the state doesn't yet report coronavirus tests by county.
Dr. Alex Garza, head of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, said the state has embarked on a study of the prevalence of coronavirus infections in certain areas of the state, and there has been discussion in the St. Louis area of doing the same.
St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson on Tuesday tweeted that she does not believe that relaxing stay-at-home restrictions "ought to be a ‘one size fits all' issue." She said officials there were making decisions "based on the best available data & science we have," and that the city needs to wait at least 14 days after the peak of cases.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said the same. He's repeatedly said that the health of state residents is his primary concern, and said models show a second wave of infections and deaths if the economy is opened too quickly. But he's also repeatedly been questioned at his daily news conferences about rural parts of the state that have few or no cases and want to be treated differently. He said that he had made an effort in a revision of rules to allow "certain areas to do more than other areas."
Parson on Wednesday said he would reevaluate the situation if coronavirus cases spike.
Garza was asked Wednesday whether the reopening of some counties in the region could undermine others. "Any time you do something that increases the probability of transmission you're always worried about the number of cases that come along with it. But really the key is how do we decrease the rate of transmission," he said.
One of the many communities chafing at restrictions that have cost millions of jobs around the country is Eureka, where Mayor Sean Flower on Tuesday night announced plans to reopen the city on Monday. "We can no longer follow the rules we are under without economic ruin," Flower wrote in a Tuesday news release.
On Wednesday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said any businesses that open in the St. Louis County portion of the Eureka area should get legal advice, adding they may have a "complicated relationship with their insurance carriers" if employees or customers were exposed to COVID-19.
Parson said, "If you're within a city, within a county, and they've got that order in place, you're going to follow that county rule."

Hospital's robotic technology takes aim at lung cancer

An innovation now available at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital holds promise to fight lung cancer. The goal of the Auris Health Monarch Platform, a novel technology that allows minimally invasive access deep inside the lungs to obtain a tissue sample for biopsy, is to enable earlier and more-accurate diagnosis of lung nodules. The technology integrates the latest advancements in robotids, software, data science and endoscopy (the use of small cameras). Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital is among the first hospitals in the United States to install the platform, which was recently cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
"This is a significant new piece of technology that will change the landscape of lung-cancer diagnosis and treatment," said Dr. Benjamin J. Seides, director of Interventional Pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital. "Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy allows us to view and take sample tissue from areas deep in the lung that previously were only accessible via more invasive methods." The Monarch Platform utilizes a familiar controller-like interface that physicians use to navigate the flexible robotic endoscope to the periphery of the lung with improved reach, vision and control. Combining traditional endoscopic views into the lung with computer-assisted navigation based on 3-D models of the patient's own lung anatomy, the Monarch Platform provides physicians with continuous bronchoscope vision throughout the entire procedure. "When a spot on the lung is detected via imaging, patients want to know as quickly as possible if it is serious and what the next steps are," Seides said. "Our goal is to obtain as much diagnostic information as possible in one procedure. For many patients, this technology helps us reduce waiting time for diagnosis and treatment." Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, in part because it has no symptoms in its early stages. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography (CT) in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30-pack per year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. CT scanning has been proven to save lives by detecting cancer earlier when it is more treatable and survivable. However, CT screening also picks up many incidental nodules that are of unclear significance, but are nevertheless cause for anxiety in many patients. "Many nodules are in difficult-to-reach locations, so the patient and provider must make the tough choice of undergoing invasive sampling versus monitoring," Seides said. "The Monarch platform makes many of these nodules safe and accessible to biopsy." Invasive sampling procedures include transthoracic needle aspiration, in which a large needle is inserted into the lung tissue using CT or ultrasound guidance. While the procedure is safe, there is a risk of pneumothorax (collapsed lung), bleeding or infection. "With robotic technology we can quickly and safely biopsy difficult-to-reach lung nodules to determine whether or not the nodule is cancerous, while at the same time obtaining staging information, frequently on the same day as the procedure," Seides said. "This is a revolutionary technology that reduces invasiveness while accelerating time to diagnosis and treatment for our patients."

Argonne National Laboratory researcher Prasanna Balaprakash will discuss artificial intelligence's impact on the development of advanced technologies at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in the Jack Turner Conference Center, Student Resource Center Room 2000, at the College of DuPage, 425 Fawell Blvd. in Glen Ellyn. This free event is part of the college's STEMinar series. 
A computer scientist in Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division, with a joint appointment in the Leadership Computing Facility, Balaprakash leads the machine-learning team and co-leads the data-understanding team in the Institute for Resource and Application Productivity through computation, Information and Data Science (RAPIDS) at the laboratory. Based on his work in the lab, Balaprakash said that artificial intelligence and machine learning are fundamentally changing the way scientists do research, as well as our understanding of the world. "In traditional problem solving, we think about the problem and figure out how to solve it," he said. "Similarly, in traditional computing, we have to tell the computer how to solve a problem. When we run into complicated problems that we can't find a solution for, we can be at a loss. With AI, we don't do that. We just give the computer examples through data and the computer learns how to solve the problem." That being said, Balaprakash added that artificial intelligence has potential to greatly benefit humankind. "As computing power becomes cheaper and we continue to generate more and more data, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities to solve problems and create beneficial technologies or treatment plans for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's."

Argonne National Laboratory researcher Prasanna Balaprakash will discuss artificial intelligence's impact on the development of advanced technologies at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 18, in the Jack Turner Conference Center, Student Resource Center Room 2000, at the College of DuPage, 425 Fawell Blvd. in Glen Ellyn. This free event is part of the college's STEMinar series. 
A computer scientist in Argonne's Mathematics and Computer Science Division with a joint appointment in the Leadership Computing Facility, Balaprakash leads the machine-learning team and co-leads the data-understanding team in the Institute for Resource and Application Productivity through computation, Information, and Data Science (RAPIDS) at the laboratory. Based on his work in the lab, Balaprakash said that artificial intelligence and machine learning are fundamentally changing the way scientists do research as well as our understanding of the world. "In traditional problem solving, we think about the problem and figure out how to solve it," he said. "Similarly, in traditional computing, we have to tell the computer how to solve a problem. When we run into complicated problems that we can't find a solution for, we can be at a loss. With AI, we don't do that. We just give the computer examples through data and the computer learns how to solve the problem." That being said, Balaprakash added that artificial intelligence has potential to greatly benefit humankind. "As computing power becomes cheaper and we continue to generate more and more data, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide unprecedented opportunities to solve problems and create beneficial technologies or treatment plans for diseases like cancer or Alzheimer's." Balaprakash earned his bachelor's degree in computer science engineering from the Periyar University in Salem, India, and his master's degree in computer science from the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg in Germany. He received his Ph.D. in engineering sciences from CoDE-IRIDIA, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, where he received Marie Curie and F.R.S-FNRS Aspirant fellowships.

Local lawmakers weigh what they can - and cannot - regulate in budding business

Missouri became the 33rd state to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes after 65% of voters in November approved Amendment 2. That started a stampede of business owners looking to capitalize on the new market.
Sales of various products are to start as early as spring. Tax proceeds and licensing fees are supposed to go into a new veterans health care fund, and are expected to generate about $20 million a year.
Licenses will be granted by Dec. 31 for medical marijuana-related businesses. Under the new law, the state is required to approve at least 10 testing facilities, 60 commercial growers, 86 facilities that make marijuana-infused products and 192 dispensaries - 24 dispensaries for each of Missouri's eight congressional districts. Officials have said they will keep licensing to the minimum. That will mean about 48 dispensaries for the St. Louis area. 
At least 667 applications - including growers, testing labs and other marijuana-based businesses - have been submitted for brick-and-mortar sites in the St. Louis area, from Elsberry to De Soto and from Washington to the city of St. Louis, according to a Post-Dispatch analysis of state records. Just under 400 of the applications were for dispensaries that would sell pot.
Missouri has approved at least at least 9,722 patients with qualifying conditions to legally buy or use marijuana, and in some cases grow it at home.
ST. CHARLES - One mayor wanted to know if people living next to a day care could grow marijuana at home. A city consultant asked whether local police can access Missouri's list of legal marijuana patients. An alderman inquired whether the state would give a boost to minority-owned marijuana businesses. Another official was concerned about where people would be allowed to smoke.
Local lawmakers across Missouri are considering the impact that marijuana - the state's newest medicinal and cash crop - will have on their communities once sales begin, as soon as spring. At least 9,700 people statewide have been approved to legally use marijuana.
"It's such a new thing and such a big change," said Dan Ross, director of the Missouri Municipal League, which includes small towns to wide suburbs across the state. "We're feeling our way through this and looking at experiences in other states. But it's not cut and dry."
The state municipal league reserved the closing keynote session of its recent annual conference in St. Charles to educate more than 200 local officials on Missouri's medical marijuana program. The league published guides on medical marijuana for its members, including one addressing changes to personnel laws.
St. Louis-area lawmakers asked about their authority to tax and regulate the new businesses. Others wanted to know whether marijuana sales will boost local tax revenue or employment. And some wanted to know how legal marijuana could complicate policing, affect property values and make neighborhoods smell.
"I think, generally speaking, the cities are looking at this more as ‘OK, the state has established this program, so now how is this going to fit in our community?'" Pat Kelly, director of the Municipal League of Metro St. Louis, said last week.The municipal league, which includes more than 80 St. Louis-area local governments, first met early this year to discuss how to adapt to a long-illegal substance becoming legal in certain uses.
Questions include how local laws will intersect with state laws and regulations - not to mention federal laws that still classify marijuana as an illegal substance. In other states, such conflicts have led to lawsuits.
Twenty-five cities in California, for example, have sued the state to overturn a rule allowing home delivery statewide regardless of whether cities allow commercial pot sales. And marijuana businesses have sued state or local lawmakers over license or permit denials and other regulations.
Advocates of the industry say cities shouldn't worry that marijuana will cause drastic changes, pointing to 32 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have either fully legalized marijuana or legalized it for medicinal use since California first allowed medical marijuana in 1996. And they say it represents an economic boon, pointing to a state auditor's office estimate that medical marijuana sales could generate $6 million in annual tax revenue for local governments.
The businesses will pay employees well and hire local contractors for services, Eric Walter, an attorney with the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, told lawmakers at the state municipal conference. The association published a 22-page guide for municipalities about the state's new medical marijuana program with a template for city ordinances and photos and floor plans for dispensaries in other states. The facilities will be high-tech and well-secured, and their owners "sophisticated business professionals," Walter said.
"They're going to be good civic, corporate citizens," Walter said. "Local governments and municipalities should want these businesses in their communities."
States that have fully legalized marijuana have all exceeded their projections for tax revenues on pot sales, said Liberty Vittert, a Washington University visiting professor of practice in data science who studies marijuana's impact on tax revenue, crime and teenage marijuana usage.
There is no correlation between marijuana legalization and increases in crime, and while there have been slight increases in teenage usage in states with legal weed, the increase could be attributed to users being more comfortable self-reporting, she said.
As for tax revenue, those states may not have met expectations in the first year, but they exceeded them once businesses were licensed and the industry was in full swing, she said.
"There is no doubt that their projections are, if nothing, conservative for what they saw in a few years - it just doesn't happen overnight," she said.
Buffer zones
Overall, local governments are fairly limited in the ordinances they can impose on medical marijuana. Most questions about commercial production and private use are addressed in the constitutional amendment Missouri voters approved in November that legalized marijuana, as well as rules state regulators drafted with public input.
State law says local governments can't prohibit legal marijuana businesses or use. But they can set the "time, place and manner" in which marijuana businesses operate, a process that is well underway in many area cities as they field inquiries from hundreds of prospective marijuana shops competing for a limited number of state licenses. That includes 400 hopeful dispensaries competing for a little more than 48 licenses for the region.
Cities have a right to waive a state requirement that forbids marijuana businesses within 1,000 feet of any school, day care or church, and they retain their usual authority to amend zoning laws to include marijuana businesses and require special permits for businesses that want to locate near residential areas.
"When it comes down to the regulation, the question is where in the city is it going to be appropriate," said Kelly, of the Municipal League of Metro St. Louis. "I think that was very clear from the state, that these businesses will still have to abide by local ordinances and all the same kinds of things that would apply to a liquor license or a new grocery store."
The city of St. Louis opted to waive the buffer zone after finding it difficult to locate any sites that would be far enough away from either a school, day care or church. The St. Louis County Council opted to keep the buffer at 1,000 feet in unincorporated areas. Creve Coeur adopted a 300-foot buffer zone. O'Fallon, Missouri, decided on 750 feet.
Many aspects of the industry have yet to be written into state or local laws, said Kenneth Heinz, an attorney who has represented several local cities.
"I bet if you look in your ordinances, you probably aren't going to find the word ‘dispensary' in there," Heinz said to those at the state municipal league conference. Rules for pharmacies or businesses with liquor licenses could also apply to marijuana dispensaries, he added.
Missouri law, for example, forbids cities from levying more "taxes" on marijuana. "Fees," which are defined as a payment of a service provided by a local government, could be levied, but businesses could sue if they feel they're unfair, Heinz said.
"So the question is, ‘When does a business license fee become a revenue-generating bias?'" he said. "All of this needs to be fleshed out with litigation," he said.
Lyndall Fraker, who directs Missouri's marijuana regulators, said at the conference that an inquiry about whether marijuana dispensaries could also sell alcohol was the first time he encountered the question. The department has largely been focused on establishing regulations for marijuana businesses and a scoring rubric for the competitive licensing process, he said.
He said state agencies are meeting every two weeks to provide guidance on medical marijuana's impact on other areas of governance, including labor laws and social services.
"We're just now getting to that part of the program," he said.
‘That's open season'
Among other concerns was how much authority local lawmakers have over people legally growing marijuana at home, to whom the state's 1,000-foot distance requirement and local zoning ordinances for businesses don't apply.
"If I'm hearing this right - that's open season," said St. Peters Mayor Len Pagano. "So they can be right next to a day care, or be next to a church."
Home growers need state approval and are allowed a limited amount, Fraker said. They need to meet state requirements that include a well-secured room accessible only by the patient or a licensed caregiver, and must allow state inspectors inside at any time.
In the end, replacement of the illegal marijuana trade with a state-regulated one will be an improvement, he said.
Roslyn Brown, Pine Lawn aldermanic president, said after the conference that the health and safety of children who live in homes legally approved to grow marijuana were among her chief concerns. Pine Lawn is a mostly residential community, she said. But the city also sees an opportunity for marijuana sales revenue.
"These kinds of things need to be worked out for a small community like ours that really needs the tax dollars," Brown said. "We're still in the discovery process."

Young adults use their phones 6 hours a day but barely touch their news apps, study shows

If the little square boxes on our phone screens are candy, then news apps, to young users, are the equivalent of chewy, high-fiber granola bars. They're on the screen, sure, but 18- to 35-year-olds will almost always swipe past them in favor of the more sugary, more seamless social media apps, says a new report from the British-based Reuters Institute and consultancy firm Flamingo Group. If and when these millennial and Gen Z readers click on the apps from The New York Times or The Washington Post, the report adds, it feels more like a chore than a treat. Researchers tracked the phone usage of 20 respondents ages 18 to 35 from the United Kingdom and the United States as part of a larger project that surveyed more than 75,000 people on their digital news consumption. 
Through a two-week qualitative study, they found that respondents were spending 350 to 400 minutes, or about six hours a day, on their phones, but often less than 1 percent of that on news apps. No news apps, with the exception of Reddit, broke the top 25 apps used. So why aren't younger audiences using news apps? According to researchers, young adults, and particularly those raised as "digital natives" as part of Generation Z (ages 18 to 24), have high expectations for a "flawless, seamless, personalized online experience" that news organizations are not often able to provide. This "seamlessness" refers to the user experience of the app — including, for example, the desire for features such as customizable news feeds with an endless scroll — but also to how news organizations integrate themselves to platforms such as Instagram or Twitter. Often, said Matt Taylor, a strategist at Flamingo who worked on the report, news organizations struggle with striking the right tone. "It's like a person and how he behaves at different social circumstances," he said. "At the moment, it's either that this person is behaving similarly in all the places, so they're not fitting in, or they're trying way too hard to fit in, sort of like a dad trying to be cool at a party." The key, Taylor said, is for news organizations to retain their brand but adapt it across multiple platforms. These instincts are embedded into the way young people use the Internet, which is why they expect it from other individuals and organizations. The other challenge for news organizations, researchers say, is that for young users, there is a near-constant level of "background" or "indirect" exposure to news that not only dulls the desire to actively seek out news through dedicated apps but can cause fatigue that drives them to seek out content that is explicitly not news — such as, you know, oddly satisfying "slime porn," or this video of a leather-clad motorcyclist in Belgium saving a tiny kitten. "To be online today is to have these currents constantly hitting you," said Lucas Galan, head of applied data science at Flamingo. " ... Just by osmosis, you can quickly become tired with a story without really engaging with it in depth." According to the study, many respondents found traditional news organizations "negative and depressing" and "actively looked for more entertaining or uplifting news in social media or aggregators." Paula M. Poindexter, a communications professor at the University of Texas at Austin, agreed, adding that based on her research, it is not just that young people are shying away from news apps but also that their general interest in the act of reading the news seems to be waning. In the past, children used to look at their parents or teachers reading the physical newspaper, which implicitly signaled to them that reading the news is an important part of adult life, she said. Since most American users — not just millennials — now get their news from social media and websites rather than the print product, children are growing up looking at adults staring at their phones, with little sense of what applications they are actually on. The "modeling" for news consumption that used to be present no longer exists, Poindexter said. Uh-oh. So now what? The researchers from Flamingo emphasize that their research does not suggest that younger audiences no longer have the appetite or, as frequently alleged by older pundits, the attention span for important journalism. They pointed, for example, to the growing interest among young adults in longer-form stories and podcasts as evidence that there is a "thirst" for deeper engagement with hard-hitting news. It just needs to be delivered on the right terms, they added. News organizations need to make their apps "as simple and intuitive as Facebook or Netflix," the report states. They also need to adapt to the platforms that younger users have already integrated into their lives — but without losing the authority of their brand. Some organizations are already trying to do this: The New York Times launched a weekly documentary TV show on Hulu and FX earlier this year and more recently aired the pilot of "Diagnosis," another documentary series on Netflix. The Washington Post runs a TikTok account that, among other highlights, got into faux "beef" with Trevor Noah's "Daily Show." Whether these efforts will pay off remains to be seen. Poindexter said she has been monitoring the news consumption habits of young users for close to a decade and still has not figured out whether active, meaningful engagement with news is evolving or fading altogether. "If we do nothing — and there's a lot of nothing being done — (the latter) could very well be the outcome," she said.

Can DPI capture the magic of Kendall Square?; Pritzker's dream project has some, but not all, of the ingredients that draw tech talent to Cambridge

Gov. J.B. Pritzker says he wants Discovery Partners Institute, the University of Illinois technology hub planned for the edge of the South Loop, to be like Kendall Square, the famed tech hothouse next to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Boston suburb of Cambridge-but bigger.
That's beyond a stretch goal. Kendall Square, a once-gritty former industrial zone, has spawned the likes of biopharma pioneers Biogen and Genzyme and internet-software maker Akamai Technologies. Thirteen of the 20 largest biopharma companies have set up shop there, alongside tech giants including Amazon, Google and Facebook.
A combination of entrepreneurial researchers, money and talent at the leading edge of genetics and data science earned Kendall Square the nickname "most innovative square mile on the planet." MIT, which has the nation's top-ranked engineering program, counts among its neighbors Harvard University and Boston's network of academic medical systems.
DPI has many of those ingredients, starting with U of I's renowned computer science and engineering programs. Chicago has a deep pool of potential corporate partners to draw from. And Bay Area tech companies, from giants such as Google to startups such as online lender Affirm, have opened sizable offices here. The amount of venture capital lags Boston.
But the biggest hurdle between Pritzker and his Kendall Square dreams may be the roughly 150 miles between Chicago and U of I's main campus in Urbana-Champaign. The most successful technology incubators are much closer to their main university partners.
Pritzker, who was a venture capitalist before he took over as governor last year, is betting $230 million in tax money that DPI can bridge the gap. His goal: use U of I's tech cred as a talent magnet and catalyst for Chicago's tech community.
Combined with $270 million for other projects at more than a dozen public universities or campuses, from Carbondale to DeKalb, it's one of the biggest economic development bets by Illinois in more than 30 years. And it comes at a crucial time for the state, which has precious little money to spare when it's facing a staggering $137 billion IOU for pensions.
"This has the potential to be game-changing for the state of Illinois, to attract people from around the world. If you want to develop an economy, great talent is what it takes," Pritzker says. "We have one of the great universities in the world in U of I."
The school's computer science and engineering programs produce nearly 1,500 graduates a year. But just 38 percent of them stay in the state. "That needs to change," says Don Edwards, the Chicago private-equity investor who chairs the U of I board of trustees and who donated $5 million to DPI.
Universities have a proven track record as powerful engines of economic development, dating back to the launch of Stanford Research Park in 1951. The Palo Alto, Calif., tech hub now has more than 150 companies employing 23,000 people. Its alumni include Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center and Facebook. Atlanta's Technology Square, affiliated with Georgia Tech and started in 2003, is home to corporate innovation centers run by AT&T, Delta Air Lines and Home Depot.
But Stanford, Kendall Square and Georgia Tech research parks are next door to universities. DPI is trying to create synergy long distance.
EFFORTS ELSEWHERE
A similar effort to DPI is underway in New York City, where Cornell University has launched Cornell Tech, a 5-acre campus on Roosevelt Island some 235 miles from its campus in upstate Ithaca. In Detroit, the University of Michigan is planning an innovation center for 1,000 graduate students about 45 miles from its Ann Arbor campus.
"It's more difficult (to do long distance)," says Eric Gordon, a professor at Michigan's Ross School of Business. "What you have to solve for in Detroit and Chicago is a critical mass of top-tier people. You have to establish it quickly."
DPI doesn't yet have backing of a major private donor like Stephen Ross, a major University of Michigan benefactor who's helping underwrite the Detroit project. The billionaire founded real estate developer Related, which is developing both the Detroit site and DPI.
But U of I scored a major coup in getting Robert Langer, an MIT biotech researcher and startup savant who is a legend in Kendall Square, to lead DPI's advisory board. "I look at Chicago as one of the great cities in the world, and it's got great universities," says Langer, who also advised the University of Chicago on its Institute for Molecular Engineering a decade ago.
Like Cornell Tech in New York, DPI plans to bring 2,000 students from its affiliated university to the city, where they'll work with private companies and faculty on research projects. But there's a key difference: Cornell Tech is setting up a campus with permanent faculty that will offer graduate engineering degrees. DPI won't, which alleviates political concerns both at the University of Illinois at Chicago, which has large, fast-growing engineering and computer science programs, and on the Urbana-Champaign campus.
"Faculty here are excited about DPI. One of the things being used as a lever to recruit new faculty is you can spend time in Chicago," says Nick Burbules, a professor of education and member of the faculty senate in Urbana-Champaign. "But you don't want a situation where someone is hired by Urbana but never on campus."
U of I also has a thriving research park in Urbana, which has 120 companies with 2,200 employees and nearly 900 student interns, and is undergoing its own expansion.
Its members include many of the same companies, such as Chicago-based ADM and Deerfield-based Caterpillar, that DPI envisions as partners. "I think the two can happen in parallel," says Laura Frerichs, executive director of the research park. "University leadership would love to see (companies) have operations in both locations."

Companies seek to capitalize on big data

Williams-Sonoma uses big data to determine the best way to target individual customers, whether through online ads, emails or catalogs. Amazon has leveraged big data to improve customer service.
Companies and organizations everywhere are seeking to capitalize on big data, generally defined as the explosion in the volume, availability and quality of data in an environment of rapidly changing digital technologies. While still an emerging field, most sectors of the economy — especially the business sector — are starting to use big data to explore new markets, sell more products, operate more efficiently and serve the public good.
As a result, the need has never been higher for professionals who can analyze and leverage these large sets of data, in fields ranging from marketing and finance to public- and private-sector research. A 2011 report from the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimated a shortage "of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills, as well as a shortage of 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions."
Colleges and universities play a leading role in producing more of these specially trained professionals. Leading-edge practitioners of data science are looking for data experts with proven skills in analytics, computer/information science and business — the whole package of quantitative, technical and business insight. But what they often see are job candidates with either technical skills or business experience, not both. Contributing to the challenge, many graduate programs focus on only one of those areas.
Last fall, Elmhurst College welcomed students to its new master's degree program in data science, a comprehensive program that provides both the technical skills to develop and manage large data sets, as well as the vital business skills to glean and apply knowledge from them in meaningful ways. In addition to their studies of the technical aspects of data science, students complete two master's-level courses in a field directly related to their specific areas of interest. The result is a strong, broad foundation of knowledge that graduates can apply to a wide variety of industries and professional settings.
For students' convenience at Elmhurst, the program is offered in a part-time, completely online format, and may be completed in as little as two years. Elmhurst College also offers a graduate certificate in data science.
Interest in the program has been keen and diverse. As a startup, the Elmhurst program anticipated enrolling about 10 new students in the first year. The program has 35 students, and is drawing interest from people across many industries, including health care, financial services, publishing and supply chain.
Career opportunities in data science include, data mining specialists, data scientists, engineers, business analysts, marketing managers, market research analysts, strategic planning analysts and information systems managers.
In a CNBC.com story headlined "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century: Data Analyst," Rob Bearden, CEO of Hortonworks, says, "The desire on the enterprise side to find truly qualified data scientists has resulted in almost open head count. It's probably the biggest imbalance of supply and demand that I've ever seen in my career. ... The talent pool is, at best, probably 20 percent of the demand."
* James Kulich and John Jeffrey are co-directors of the master's in data science program at Elmhurst College.

Don't sell my data! We finally have a law for that

With apologies to the Beastie Boys: You gotta fight for your right to privacy. America's first broad data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act, went into effect Jan. 1. These days, a wild range of companies gather and sell your data, from Ford and Chipotle to Uber and Walmart. Now the CCPA gives you the power to say cut it out. And while the law technically covers only California residents, Americans living anywhere can use the CCPA to reset their relationships with more than a dozen major businesses (and counting). Just know that some companies are going to make you jump through hoops. 
To help, I'm breaking the CCPA down into bites. I've been learning how to use the law by filing requests to more than 100 companies. To be covered by the CCPA, companies have to make more than $25 million per year or collect data on more than 50,000 people. They're not incentivized to make it easy: Amazon hid critical links in legal gobbledygook. Marketing data company LiveRamp asked me to submit a selfie holding my own ID, kidnap-victim style. Walmart asked for my astrological sign to confirm my identity. (Really.) And one business left me a voice mail, but the message included no return number ... or even the name of the company. (Please call back!) Yet I've also been pleasantly surprised: Some of the biggest businesses, including Netflix, Microsoft, Starbucks and UPS, are extending CCPA rights to all Americans rather than just Californians. That makes some sense: It's additional work for companies to try to confirm where people live. And frankly, it's not a good look for them to claim they care about customer privacy and then discriminate against Americans who don't live in California. Many of these companies tell me they'll participate when Congress passes a federal data privacy law, which they know isn't likely anytime soon. Privacy advocates have mixed feelings about the CCPA. It's true that it creates too much work for many people — and everyone deserves privacy, even if they're not willing to jump through hoops. But I'm in the camp that thinks the CCPA is an important step forward. I spent the past year following the secret life of the data on my phone, car and credit cards, often confronting a stone wall from companies. Now we all have the legal authority to demand answers about what's happening with our data. For example, the CCPA has already revealed that Amazon keeps a record of everything you do on a Kindle, from when you start and stop reading to when you highlight a word. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, but I review all tech with the same critical eye.) The CCPA is far from a perfect privacy law, but it's the one America has in 2020. I want to hear what you discover using it. I'm hopeful it will fuel an overdue public conversation about what kind of surveillance is OK — and what crosses the line. Q: What does the CCPA do? A: On its own, the CCPA won't do much for your privacy. But if you take some action, it gives you three useful rights: 1) You can ask companies to show you exactly what data they've collected about you. 2) You can instruct companies not to "sell" your data. The word "sell" is in quotes because the law defines that pretty broadly as an exchange of value. (There's a lot of debate about that, though — see below.) 3) You can ask companies to delete your data, unless doing so would create a security threat or interfere with someone else's free speech. Even better, the law says companies are not allowed to treat you differently or charge you money just for exercising your data rights. There's also a special restriction for children: If you're under 16, a company needs you to explicitly opt in before they can sell your information. Q: Is it like the European law? A: The CCPA is a bit like a European law you may have heard about, called the General Data Protection Regulation. What's different is that the CCPA doesn't require companies to minimize the data they collect in the first place. Privacy advocates also think the CCPA is sorely missing the ability for consumers to file lawsuits against companies that violate their rights. Only the California attorney general can do that now. Q: How much work is this? A: You have to go to each and every company to exercise your CCPA rights. Yes, that could become a never-ending project. But the good news is that many companies have web forms you can fill out like busywork. I submitted about a hundred in less time than it took me to binge the most recent season of "The Crown." So far there's no tool to help you do this all at once or service that will manage your data for you, though I've heard from several start-ups working on that. Keep in mind that some online services, including Facebook, say a "delete" request involves totally shutting your account, rather than just pressing a reset button on all the unwelcome surveillance of your life. Q: What hoops might companies make me jump through? A: Before you dive into making requests, get organized. You'll need to have access to your usernames, passwords and loyalty card numbers. (If you don't already have a password manager to keep all your important information organized, this is an excellent time to get one.) Companies can ask you to prove your identity, and if there are errors or missing information they can reject your request. Scan or photograph your driver's license; many sites required me to upload it, or a version that was redacted. Data firm Wiland even asked me for a notarized letter. (I reminded it that CCPA requests aren't supposed to cost consumers anything, and the company suggested I seek out a free notary at a government office or credit union.) Some companies will try to shift work onto you. Airbnb and PayPal, among others, make you email them requests, rather than using web forms. Instead of a simple "do not sell" switch, companies including MasterCard make you manage a series of privacy "preferences" (as if anyone's preference would be to have their data sold). To opt out, Best Buy says you have to change your web browser to block all cookies (breaking some sites) and dig into your phone settings to turn off some advertising tracking. Don't let any of this stop you from demanding your rights. The most common annoyance is firms hiding their CCPA instructions behind many links and impenetrable privacy policies. Q: Is there any information that isn't covered? A: Companies don't have to share information that's already public, that they've collected in a job interview or that they've aggregated in ways that don't identify you. Some companies have come up short in what they actually disclose. For example, in CCPA requests it returned to me, Amazon has yet to share what data it collects in its camera-equipped Amazon Go convenience stores. And businesses already covered by a few existing privacy laws are exempt — even if those laws don't require transparency like the CCPA. That means banks and doctor's offices generally don't have to abide. Q: What counts as data ‘sale'? A: This is one of the most-debated questions in tech right now. The CCPA says selling data is a transfer of information for commercial purposes. That's obvious where one company pays another for, say, your burrito purchase history. But many businesses, particularly ones involved in online advertising, pass along information in other ways, such as tracker cookies and pixels hidden on websites and apps. Some of the biggest firms, including Facebook, Amazon and Google, contend the "do not sell" request part of the CCPA doesn't apply to them because they don't sell our data. They just make billions off our data by using it to target ads and train artificial intelligence software. Others are claiming an out because the law is too vague. For example, Spotify's privacy policy says it shares your personal information with advertisers — but the music service doesn't think that should count as a sale. "It is currently unclear whether the use of certain types of advertising partners would be considered a sale under CCPA," the company says. The authors of the CCPA say they intended the term "sale" to reflect the wider data economy. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra hasn't yet published guidelines for how his office will interpret the law, and we might not get firm answers until his office begins enforcing it. That's set to begin July 1. Q: Once I have my data, what do I do with it? A: First, keep it secure by storing it only on a computer you control with a password. Most of the data requests I've received so far have come in formats I can easily read, such as text files or PDFs. But not all: Twitter sent me files in a. js format that requires a data science degree to understand. (The company says it is working to improve that.) I'm still waiting to hear back on most of my requests; the law gives companies up to 90 days to deliver. But already I learned that WiFi router maker Eero, owned by Amazon, keeps a detailed log of every device that's ever connected to my network. (It's like a creepy visitor guest book.) Fandango not only tallied all the movies I've watched but also concluded I have an affinity for the Muppets. (True.) When you examine your data, keep an eye out for information you didn't know the company had — or don't think it should. If you don't like what you see, submit a CCPA delete request. Or stop doing business with the company, and be sure to tell it why. If you think a company is violating your privacy — or violating the CCPA — you can complain to the California attorney general (click here for a direct link). Q: OK, let's do it! Where do I click? A: The list below includes many of the companies where I've submitted CCPA requests. I've separated out the companies that have indicated they'll offer CCPA rights to all Americans. There are more resources available: A crowdsourced list stored on GitHub, an online resource for coders, has an even longer list of links to company-specific CCPA information pages. Common Sense Media is also building out the website Donotsell.org as a resource for CCPA requests, as is CAPrivacy.org, run by one of the authors of the law. The Electronic Frontier Foundation offers a simple guide on its website, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center has a handy draft form letter to use in cases where companies don't offer web forms. If you're looking for a company not included in any of these resources, I recommend finding the privacy policy on its website and searching for the word California — that's typically the best place to start. These companies accept CCPA requests from all Americans: Amazon Apple DoorDash Facebook Google Lutron Microsoft Netflix PayPal Ring Roku Starbucks Strava Toyota Twitter Uber UPS Wiland Zillow — — — These companies accept CCPA requests from California residents: Acxiom Airbnb Alaska Airlines Albertsons/Safeway Altria AT&T Best Buy BevMo Chipotle Comcast Xfinity CVS Disney Dominos eBay Eero Epsilon Equifax Equinox Experian Face App Ford General Motors Honda Hulu i360 JetBlue Kayak Live Nation LiveRamp Lyft Macy's Marriott MasterCard Nissan OpenTable Orangetheory Fitness Pinterest Quora Redfin Resy Samsung SiriusXM Southwest Airlines Spotify Staples Target Ticketmaster TransUnion Truedata Uber Unilever Verizon Verizon Media Visa Volkswagen Walmart Washington Post Whitepages Whole Foods Yelp

Its weedkillers under attack, Bayer develops new herbicide
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)
February 14, 2020 Friday
FINAL EDITION

ST. LOUIS - With a pair of the company's mainstay herbicides losing punch against resistant weeds and under siege from lawsuits, Bayer officials said Thursday that its scientists are advancing development of a new weedkilling molecule - billed as the first new product of its kind to come along in decades.
The announcement was a key highlight from calls with investors and the media, as Bayer Crop Science officials provided updates on the company's research and development pipeline.
The new herbicide molecule - the name of which has not yet been released - is entering a second phase of development, according to Bayer, and is not expected to become commercially available for nearly a decade.
"We're super excited by this breakthrough," said Bob Reiter, the head of research and development for Bayer's Crop Science Division.
Company officials said it is seen as an eventual complement - and not a replacement - for today's popular and profitable weedkilling chemicals like glyphosate, sold as Roundup, and dicamba, both of which are facing high-profile lawsuits over allegations of adverse impacts to human or crop health.
Bayer, however, outlined continued reliance on each. Reiter described them as "anchors" of the company's herbicide offerings, citing their respective versatility and effectiveness killing weeds.
The company also said that public complaints and concerns regarding Roundup and dicamba did not contribute any added urgency to the development of alternatives.
"There's always urgency for growers to have more choice and more options," said Reiter.
The emerging technology has been in the works for more than five years already, Reiter said. That work began under Bayer, prior to its 2018 acquisition of Monsanto, the Creve Coeur-based crop science giant.
Details remain scarce about how the new product will work, but Bayer says it will kill weeds in novel ways, compared to existing herbicides. That new "mode of action," Reiter said, is expected to make it harder for plants to develop resistance.
"Weeds haven't seen this before, so they're going to be challenged," said Reiter.
Bayer said it has been 30 years since a similarly novel weedkilling technology debuted in agriculture.
Reiter expressed hope that continued breakthroughs could await the company, particularly as data science and artificial intelligence help accelerate the process of identifying promising angles for innovation.
"There's still a lot of room for discovery," he said.

Robots are solving banks' very expensive research problem

As lawmakers in Brasilia debated a controversial pension overhaul for months, a robot more than 5,000 miles away in London kept a close eye on all 513 of them. The algorithm, designed by technology startup Arkera Inc., tracked their comments in Brazilian newspapers and government web pages each day to predict the likelihood the bill would pass. Weeks before the legislation cleared its biggest obstacle in July, the machine's data crunching allowed Arkera analysts to predict the result almost to the letter, giving hedge fund clients in New York and London the insight to buy the Brazilian real near eight-month lows in May. It's since rallied more than 8%. This is the kind of edge that a new generation of researchers are betting will upend the research marketplace. 
For Arkera's clients on Wall Street and in the City of London, that means getting robots to filter through the noise in faraway lands. "There's too many people to follow on Twitter, too many websites, too many articles," said Nav Gupta, the 48-year-old co-founder of Arkera, which says its software can process as much information as 1,000 human analysts. "That's a very expensive problem and everybody faces it." The company raised 4 million pounds ($4.9 million) last year from investors including Alan Howard of hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management. Using so-called artificial intelligence to automate swathes of the research process is quickly gaining traction because cost-conscious investment banks are downsizing. In the U.K. alone, there was a 30% drop in research budgets last year, Financial Conduct Authority data show. At the 12 biggest banks, there's been a 7% drop since 2015 in the number of front-office staff covering currencies, such as traders and researchers, according to London-based research analytics consultancy Coalition Development Ltd. That means it's even harder than it used to be to afford analysts on the ground in developing nations, about the only places in the world where investors can get yield right now. Data-science companies like Arkera and New York-based Sigmoidal say they can solve this problem using machines that learn as they go to dredge through tens of thousands of news articles, government statements and social media accounts in languages as varied as Spanish, Arabic and Chinese. After an initial investment of up to $100,000, banks can save $1 million over seven years using such systems because they don't need to hire as many data analysts, said Marek Bardonski, who was chief executive officer of Sigmoidal when he spoke with Bloomberg in July. He has since left the company. Previously, Bardonski, 27, was a computer scientist at graphics chipmaker Nvidia. Take this year's protests in Hong Kong. Bardonski said Sigmoidal's software was able to track developments in the Cantonese-language press and even identify the non-verified Twitter feeds of protest leaders to monitor the risk of further unrest. The technology is useful for faraway countries wracked by political turmoil, places where investors are keen to put money but don't have easy access to information. "The system can give an edge over traditional analysts working for financial institutions," said Bardonski, who said typical reports will include charts on sentiment, key word statistics and short written summaries. "Instead of getting 100,000 news articles, clients can get all the insights on one page." Neither Sigmoidal nor Arkera would let Bloomberg see an example of an automated report to see how readable it is compared with one produced by a human, citing rules against sharing proprietary data. In Europe, the way investors consume research has evolved fast since new rules last year forced investors for the first time to pay separately for the analysis they receive. The so-called MiFID II legislation stopped a widespread practice of having the cost of research built into the fees that the likes of Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley got paid to execute trades. The irony is that a year and a half since the rules came into force, many investment banks still offer research for free because clients aren't willing to pay for it, according to Sarah Jane Mahmud, a senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who specializes in regulation. They get around the rules by publishing research on their websites for public consumption. But the quality has gone downhill because midlevel analysts have left or been pushed out, leaving junior analysts to do the work so their more senior colleagues can go to client meetings. This is giving investors even more impetus to seek out bespoke research, like paying cash to speak with experts in the field or investing in automated research to support their senior fund managers and strategists. "Asset managers now need to assess the value of every single research service to assess if it's worth paying for, how much they should pay for it, and trying to filter the good from the bad," Mahmud said. Under MiFID II, asset managers must be prepared to demonstrate they've done due diligence on all investments they make for their clients, something that's always been tricky in developing countries. It was that very problem that inspired Gupta and his business partner Vinit Sahni, whose careers spanned firms including Citadel LP, DE Shaw & Co. and Goldman Sachs, to set up Arkera in 2015. During their 20-year careers in investment banking, trying to find information to substantiate something felt "like pulling teeth," Sahni, 50, said. So the pair set up a team of data scientists and engineers to design a search engine that investors can use to give them an edge in places like Turkey, Mexico and Egypt. It works kind of like Google, only it's programmed to choose the most relevant sources from tens of thousands of articles, social media feeds and government releases. As good as robots are getting at deciphering market jargon, even their developers admit they'll never fully replace humans. In the next decade, Sahni said smart machines will significantly enhance the capabilities of human analysts. "We will see advancements in cognitive abilities, communication and the physical potential of humans as we collaborate closely with machines and algorithms," he said.

THE QUIET TECH STAR; While peers flock to hipster havens, Paylocity crushes it in the burbs

You won't find Chicago's best-performing technology company among the digerati in converted lofts and warehouses on the Near West Side. It's out in Schaumburg, occupying the kind of traditional suburban office building so many companies have fled for downtown digs in recent years.
Paylocity's name likely rings no bells with most people who drive by its glass high-rise every day. Payroll software doesn't generate that kind of buzz. That's OK with CEO Steve Beauchamp.
"In many ways, we think of ourselves as a hidden secret. We're in the suburbs, focused on (small and midsize businesses)."
Paylocity's steadily rising sales and profits have lifted the stock 84 percent this year, the best of any Illinois public company. It went public five years ago, just before Grubhub. Since then, Paylocity's stock has outpaced its better-known peer nearly 3-to-1. Paylocity shares debuted at $17 and closed Aug. 29 at $110.87.
Companies, especially small ones, are eager to offload the hassles of payroll. They're willing to dump other headaches, too, such as onboarding new workers, tracking performance and training.
Paylocity's sweet spot is small companies, typically with 100 employees or fewer. A big part of its growth lately is coming from customers half that size. While there are more of them, smaller companies generate less revenue if you sell software based on headcount, as Paylocity does. If Beauchamp wants to maintain Paylocity's steady climb, he'll have to keep pedaling faster. So far, he has proven to be a skilled rider.
"We've had 10 straight quarters of mid-20 percent growth," says Beauchamp, 47. "Our long-term goal is to get to $1 billion in the next four fiscal years."
Unlike some fast-growing tech companies, 22-year-old Paylocity hasn't struggled to generate consistent profits. Net income rose 39 percent to $54 million last year as revenue climbed 24 percent to $468 million.
Over the past three years, Paylocity has increased the number of customers and their average spending with the company at the same rate-about 40 percent.
"It's a boring business but in a good way," says Corey Greendale, who follows Paylocity at First Analysis in Chicago. "There's nothing particularly extraordinary that's happened: They keep chugging along, putting points on the board. It's a good industry with relatively low risk, good growth."
Giants ADP and Paychex dominate payroll processing. Ultimate Software, which plays more in the midmarket and has about $1 billion in annual revenue, was taken private this year in an $11 billion buyout. Paylocity competes with Oklahoma-based Paycom Software for smaller customers.
There's plenty of room, says Brian Peterson, an Atlanta-based analyst at Raymond James. "ADP churns 10 percent of a $9.9 billion business every year. Paylocity only needs a fraction of that."
Beauchamp plans to keep adding customers and more services for them to buy. "We have a lot of new customers to the platform and customers adopting more of our products," he says. The company has grown its client base from about 15,000 to 20,000 in the past three years. Their annual spending per employee has grown from $285 to $400.
"We figure there are 600,000 businesses between 20 and 1,000 employees, so there's lots of runway."
Beauchamp forecasts 21 percent revenue growth in the coming year, compared with 26 percent last year. But Paylocity has a history of beating its targets.
People and products are key to maintaining growth. Paylocity's sales force grew 23 percent last year to 382. "There are only so many good, experienced payroll sales reps out there, so there's always some execution risk," Greendale says. "But 25 percent of their business comes from benefits brokers, which has been a great driver."
The company also spends about 14 percent of revenue on research and product development, nearly double that of Paycom, which is about 20 percent bigger by revenue.
One new Paylocity product enables employers to give workers some of their accrued pay before formal pay periods. Paylocity also added an employee-survey tool and a dashboard that uses machine learning to predict whether employees might be at risk of leaving. The newest product is a learning-management tool that allows companies to create and share training content with employees.
Paylocity has been willing to buy as well as build, acquiring BeneFlex HR Resources, a maker of health-spending software, for $6.7 million in 2018.
"It was a purely transactional product five or 10 years ago," says Beauchamp, who was hired in 2007 to take over for founder Steven Sarowitz, who remains chairman. "It's more content and analytics now."
The evolution puts Paylocity in position to benefit from another trend, says Arvind Ramnani, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. "The next generation of cloud spending will be on back-end apps like payroll. That's where the action is at."
But as Paylocity focuses on more sophisticated products, it needs more tech talent. Finding it is Beauchamp's biggest challenge. "It's competitive to find great software engineers and salespeople," though he says it's not hard to recruit workers to the suburbs.
So far Paylocity seems to be winning. The company recently hired Adam McElhinney from Uptake Technologies, where he was head of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence strategy.
"The question I get from investors is, 'How can it last?' " Greendale says. "But people were asking that two years ago."

The Pydata March Meetup was hosted by Daniel Little and Ji Dong and sponsored by Allstate. MacLeod and Wigell presented first followed by Itay Livni who presented on software for educational vocabulary. 
After each presentation, the audience members were given time to ask questions and share their own insights followed by a meet and greet at the end of the meetup. After the presentation, Livni joined the SCF team as a Consultant. Wigell stated, "With his experience, he will be a great addition to the team." Wigell credits the Pydata Meetup for introducing Livni to SCF. MacLeod and Wigell have created a predictive order technology for CPG wholesalers that predicts what products will be ordered by a salesperson for beverage wholesalers in a large format grocery store. They are working with an obfuscated transactional data set from a major CPG beverage wholesaler. During their presentation they discussed how they made their choices, the issues they ran into, presenting historical vs. predicted data visually, and how they are solving problems by using Tableau data visualizations. They provided key insights into how this technology can benefit CPG wholesalers and what effects this could have on time and revenue. Together, MacLeod and Wigell have spent 30+ years working with IT, analytics, data science, and data visualization. While the case presented applied SCF's predictive order technology to beverage distribution, the predictive order technology is available to the consumer packaged goods industry.

A coworking company that has provided shared office space since long before the concept had a well-known name is planning an expansion of up to 30 facilities in the suburbs. Office Evolution, based in Boulder, Colorado, hopes to grow its network of four shared office centers in the suburbs by attracting new franchisees to open sites in places other than Lisle, Naperville, Hoffman Estates and the Rosemont/Chicago border. Founder and CEO Mark Hemmeter says suburban entrepreneurs who run their own businesses such as law offices, accounting firms, coaching practices or consulting services are the market Office Evolution targets. 
"We're really focused on the suburbs," he said. "And the suburbs are somewhat ignored." In the coworking or shared office market, Hemmeter said it's easy to find a place to snag a desk for the day or rent an office for a month — in Chicago, that is. But in the suburbs — although the coworking market has expanded during the past five years, coinciding with the growth of ride-sharing and homesharing services — he said options are more limited. With 16 years in the industry, Hemmeter said Office Evolution wants to offer more sites in the region where business people who work alone or with small teams can secure space with all office amenities included and less hassle than a typical 5-year lease. "Entrepreneurs and small business owners are very savvy, and they need flexible places to work," Hemmeter said. "They don't want to make long-term commitments." Franchisees Joshua and Ashley Shi recognized the need in Lisle and Naperville for workplaces less distracting than home, more professional than Starbucks and more private than the library. For prices between $169 and $1,200 a month, depending on services and space needed, businesspeople can gain access to a desk or furnished office with a phone number, receptionist, Wi-Fi, printer, fax machine and kitchen at 650 Warrenville Road, Suite 100 in Lisle or 1755 Park St., Suite 200 in Naperville. In Lisle, the package comes with an on-site gym membership, too. "We take care of everything for you so you can run your business," Joshua Shi said. Inside 8,000 square feet in Lisle, for example, Office Evolution offers 27 offices, two conference rooms and access to a training room. Using these offices are CPAs, attorneys, scientists, movie producers and nonprofit organizations. Shi, who has a background in cybersecurity, said he sees himself as "a matchmaker for businesses," not a landlord. He's helped entrepreneurs connect with other Office Evolution coworking members or his own contacts when they've needed services in the legal, accounting, web design or data science fields. Joshua's wife, Ashley Shi, is a classical piano teacher who says clients also appreciate the ability to separate their work and home lives. "This definitely helps them to create that balance," she said. The Shis say they are considering opening more Office Evolution sites in DuPage or Will County, possibly in Oak Brook or Joliet. Hemmeter said the company is recruiting more franchisees, with details available at http://officeevolutionfranchise.com/.

Five years ago-an eternity in the world of tech startups-two college buddies from India, both living in Chicago, decided to build software that would give the then-emerging class of Airbnb hosts the ability to quickly adjust their prices based on shifts in demand.
Anurag Verma, who built dynamic pricing tools for United Airlines, provided the technical know-how. The business insight came from Richie Khandelwal, a Northwestern University MBA student and frustrated Airbnb host. They recruited a third Chicago co-founder, software engineer Syed Hassan, and built the first version of their product, PriceLabs.
There was just one problem: None of the three founders had time to actually build the company. So though the product gained enough traction to inspire several years of nights-and-weekends work, its growth was stunted, and Verma, for one, remained unsure of its prospects.
Then, suddenly, something clicked. More than 200 customers signed up in 2017, bringing more than a thousand new properties onto PriceLabs' platform. (Customers pay $20 per property per month, with volume discounts when they list multiple units.) In early 2018, Verma took the plunge and became PriceLabs' first full-time leader.
There was professional risk, of course, in leaving his post at United to work at a startup-especially considering he had a 1-year-old son at home in Lincoln Park. But the greater challenge was performing the duties of an executive, spending hours each day negotiating deals and walking customers through the platform's intricacies. "When I'm doing data science, I know what the boundaries are and how things are done," says Verma, 33. "Sales requires a different set of skills because there aren't as many concrete rules."
He's been learning on the fly, a job made easier by PriceLabs' standout product. As Verma took the reins, he knew word was spreading that PriceLabs-despite its spartan user interface and low profile compared to better-funded competitors such as San Francisco-based Beyond Pricing-was delivering the goods.
"They were like this silent killer, lurking behind some of the bigger names," says Megan McCrea, president of the Nashville Area Short-Term Rental Association. She credits PriceLabs with 30 to 60 percent increases in her rental business's monthly revenue since she signed up in 2017 and says that while PriceLabs "doesn't have all the pretty graphs and cool colors, when you dig into the functionality, that's where you see the level of sophistication."
Verma managed to parlay those technical chops into threefold growth during 2018, surpassing 1,000 customers, some of whom are listing thousands of properties on the platform. He's also hiring: PriceLabs added two part-time sales reps, in the U.S. and Europe, last year and this year added a full-time data scientist at its headquarters in a Loop co-working space. He plans to expand the full-time headcount to a half-dozen by the end of 2019, including Hassan and Khandelwal, who is moving back from India, where he's spent the last two years running business operations for a larger startup.

From Silicon Valley to Wall Street, there's increasing demand for highly-skilled workers in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. But there's a limited pool of talent, and viable candidates who smell the desperation are putting a high price on their skills. The number of job postings featuring "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning" in their description has doubled since 2015, according to global jobs site Indeed.com. 
Prospective employees are increasingly seeking out those jobs, too. Search entries for AI and machine learning positions have increased by 182 percent over the last three years. But more job searches don't mean more qualified applicants, as industries struggle to find sufficiently skilled candidates. "As AI development and adoption continues to rise across industries, it's likely there will be more competition for this talent," said Raj Mukherjee, senior vice president of product at Indeed. "It may be cause for concern for employers looking to find workers with AI skill sets, since these jobs require highly skilled workers with backgrounds in natural language processing, machine learning, and data science." Indeed said it analyzed millions of job postings in the U.S. from June 2015 through June 2018. The report identified job titles that saw more than 20 percent of postings list "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning" in the description and derived information about salary and location. If you're looking to get into AI, set your sights on New York City, according to the report. Surprisingly, New York and not San Francisco boasts the highest percentage of AI and machine learning positions in a single metro area, with more than 11 percent of national job postings. The technology sector has offered the highest-paying jobs in the U.S. for the last four consecutive years, according to a recent Glassdoor report. Companies such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. have long paid lucrative salaries to highly technical candidates with machine learning skills. Now other industries, including finance and health care, are doling out hefty paychecks as they seek to grab AI talent. Across the board, companies are paying six-figure salaries to attract workers from a limited pool of qualified candidates. A director of analytics received the highest average pay among AI and machine learning jobs this year, topping off at $140,837, the report stated. Principal scientists, machine learning engineers, computer vision engineers and data scientists also saw highly competitive salaries, with the lowest average base pay well over $130,000. "The industry needs to be creative in order to solve the supply-demand imbalance, one way to do so is by embracing jobseekers with nontraditional backgrounds or by training them on the job," Mukherjee said. "As companies continue to adopt AI solutions or develop their own in-house capabilities, it's likely that demand by employers for these skills will continue to rise."

LIFE AFTER GROUPON: ERIC LEFKOFSKY & BRAD KEYWELL; One's a billionaire, the other's a hundred-millionaire. They were instrumental in founding the deals company that put Chicago's tech scene on the map. What are they up to now? Plenty.

When you're one of three founders of Groupon, the company that energized Chicago's tech scene, what do you do with the rest of your life? If you're Andrew Mason, you head for the West Coast. If you're Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell, you stay in Chicago and start more companies, fund others with a VC firm, and get involved in Chicago's civic and philanthropic community.
That Lefkofsky and Keywell, business partners for 25 years, have remained in the city to create new businesses "triples the credibility of Chicago," says Erik Gordon, associate clinical professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, where both Lefkofsky and Keywell attended university and law school. "If they thought they needed to go elsewhere to staff the companies or finance them, they would have." Gordon says it's difficult to think of a contemporary parallel for their long business partnership. "For them to still be friends and stay together-it's sort of a Hewlett and Packard situation," he says.
While the collective Chicago tech consciousness still links Groupon and Lefkofsky and Keywell, the two men have accomplished much over the past 10 years. In addition to Groupon, they have launched and taken public two additional companies: InnerWorkings, a tech-based marketing firm, and Echo Global Logistics, a transportation brokerage firm. The three businesses employ a total of 7,000 people. Their newest tech companies, Tempus Labs and Uptake, are "unicorns" that employ more than 1,000 combined.
According to government filings, Lefkofsky's take from stock sales related to their three publicly traded companies is at least $500 million, while Keywell's is $200 million.
In addition, the portfolio of their venture-capital firm, Lightbank, includes dozens of Chicago-based startups, among them lunch firm Fooda, social media company Sprout Social and Drivin, which helps car dealers manage inventory.
Both play significant roles in the city's civic scene, Lefkofsky through board service at blue-chip nonprofits and Keywell via Chicago Ideas, the nonprofit "ideas platform" he founded in 2011. Here's a synopsis of their lives today, plus a philanthropy-focused Q&A, edited and condensed from emailed answers.
ERIC LEFKOFSKY, 48
Estimated net worth: $2.2 billion; he ranks 359th on the 2017 Forbes 400 list of the country's richest people.
Groupon tie: He is chairman, having served as CEO, and holds about 86 million shares of the company's stock, or 15 percent.
Business: In 2016, Lefkofsky launched Tempus Labs, which collects and analyzes clinical and molecular data from hospitals and cancer centers around the country. Tempus provides genomic sequencing services and other tools to physicians so they can craft personalized treatment for their patients. The company has partnerships with, among others, Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Rush University, University of Chicago Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, via access to the society's CancerLinQ database of cancer treatment results. The company has 450 employees and is valued at more than $1 billion.
Philanthropy: Lefkofsky Family Foundation has granted north of $50 million since its founding in 2006. Lefkofksy's wife, Liz, is the foundation's president and director. It focuses on education, arts and culture, human rights, and medical causes; initiatives include Success Bound, which helps middle school kids successfully transition to high school. Between August 2016 and December 2017, the Lefkofskys transferred 10 million shares of Groupon to their family foundation. The stock would be worth $40.5 million at today's prices.
Nonprofit boards: Lefkofsky chairs the board of trustees at Steppenwolf Theatre. He is also a trustee at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Science & Industry, and on the boards of directors at Lurie Children's Hospital and World Business Chicago.
Giving Pledge: In 2013, the Lefkofskys signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's Giving Pledge, in which signers promise to give away half their wealth.
BRAD KEYWELL, 48
Estimated net worth: $600 million
Groupon tie: He is no longer a director or reportable shareholder.
Business: In 2014, Keywell started Uptake Technologies, which describes itself as "an industrial AI software platform harnessing predictive analytics to deliver outcomes of increased productivity, reliability, safety and cybersecurity to global industry." The company has 800 employees and is valued at $2.2 billion. Its philanthropic arm, Uptake.org, aims to use Big Data to solve social ills; its six-month Data Fellows program connects data professionals at nonprofits, foundations and social-enterprise firms with data science and data security experts.
Philanthropy: In 2011, Keywell launched Chicago Ideas, a nonprofit that's become known for its weeklong fall festival of dozens of seminars focused on business and social issues, such as prison reform. Chicago Ideas also hosts programs throughout the year. Keywell and his wife, Kim, launched Keywell Foundation in 2011 and have donated upward of $30 million to charitable causes via the foundation and private giving. The foundation makes grants to organizations that encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.
Nonprofit boards: Keywell is founder and chairman of Chicago Ideas and Future Founders Foundation. He is on the Business Advisory Council of Northwestern University Transportation Center; on the board of councilors at USC Iovine & Young Academy; and a trustee at Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
Giving Pledge: The Keywells signed the Gates/Buffett Giving Pledge in 2015.
IN THEIR OWN WORDS: AN EMAIL Q&A
Crain's: What would you say is your biggest philanthropic accomplishment over the last 10 years?
Lefkofsky: I'm most passionate about the work I've done, both through our family foundation and Tempus, as it relates to funding cancer research and trying to advance our understanding and our ultimate ability to positively impact those suffering from the disease.
Keywell: Creating Chicago Ideas Week with our CEO Jessica Malkin and our Executive Producer and Creative Director Carrie Kennedy, taking it from an idea that I had to what it is today (in its ninth year), and continuing to actively pursue its highest potential.
How would you characterize the philanthropy of Chicago's tech community?
Lefkofsky: Chicago has always had an incredibly passionate and committed philanthropic community. People I talk to are constantly amazed at how engaged our civic and philanthropic leaders are with the city at large.
Keywell: Our tech community has a special essence of hard work, grit and determination, and it seems we've all embraced philanthropy as an essential aspect of our purpose. I think this "do good while doing well" mentality is one of the many philosophical underpinnings that makes our technology community so dynamic.
What philanthropic legacy would you like to leave?
Lefkofsky: I would like to have played a meaningful role in reducing the plight of cancer and other diseases by helping to usher in precision medicine, with the goal of saving 100,000 lives annually within the next decade.
Keywell: I think we all want to "matter," in whatever way we each define it. And with age and experience, we develop a richer and deeper sense of mattering, of purpose. So it's not easy to talk about "legacy" when you're still in the midst of refining the true sense of purpose. That being said, some basic principles drive us. Giving financially to organizations that drive impact is essential-just as the entrepreneurial journey is about being impact-creating, so too is the philanthropic journey. And we believe strongly in "giving your genius."

This fall, a total of 2,001 undergraduate students will engage in Performance Learning at Millikin University, both in and outside the classroom. The total amount of undergraduate students for fall 2018 is the largest number at Millikin since fall 2015. With an increase of 3.6 percent in traditional undergraduate students, Millikin University welcomed 473 first-year students to campus at the start of the fall 2018 semester. "We are very pleased with this year's incoming class, strong in numbers and academically, with all kinds of outstanding talent," said Millikin President Dr. Patrick E. White. "Students across the country are discovering that Millikin's commitment to Performance Learning will build their ability and their confidence to shape dynamic and exciting lives to become their best imagination of who they are. It is a great time to be at Millikin. 
With a growing body and new buildings and programs coming on line, the Millikin momentum is going strong." Millikin University welcomed 90 honors students in the freshman class and enrolled a record 95 international students from 30 countries. Among the international students is Lan Dao, a first-year information systems major from Hanoi, Vietnam. "I discovered Millikin through a spontaneous situation," Dao said. "I was scrolling up and down the U.S. News & World Report website and curiosity struck me when I saw the name ‘Millikin University.' I received assistance from the admission office and they guided me through the entire application process. I could clearly feel that they really did care a lot for their applicants. I have been at Millikin for three weeks and I am happy about my life here. Millikin's International Student Orientation and Welcome Week involved many exciting and helpful activities. I feel welcomed and included." Millikin is also bringing in talented out-of-state students with 33 percent of the fall 2018 first-year class coming from outside Illinois — a seven percent increase for the institution. In addition to the increase of traditional undergraduate students, Millikin also saw a five percent increase in graduate student enrollment, including increased numbers in Millikin's Graduate Nursing program and MBA Fast-Track program. "We are very excited to see increased enrollment with our traditional undergraduate students as well as our graduate programs," said Sarah Shupenus, vice president for enrollment and marketing at Millikin. "These numbers show that Millikin students value their college experience and their level of engagement. We are continuing to show students, in Illinois and outside the state, the importance of Performance Learning and that Millikin is a great return on investment." Millikin University is continuing to grow in many ways throughout campus and in the classroom. Construction on Millikin's new Center for Theatre and Dance is ongoing and construction on the Workman Family Baseball Field is set to begin soon. New majors are also being offered for this academic year in criminal justice, data science, and a video production concentration through the Arts Technology major. When asked about her experience at Millikin, Lan Dao says it's the people that have made the difference. "Everyone here is always willing to help and support you, from the professors, the staff, to your peer friends," Dao said. "It's a small university with a beautiful campus and the major I want to pursue, information systems. What I have learned for three weeks is that when you need help, there is always someone who can help you and it is not hard to find the resources." Millikin University is a private, comprehensive university with a diverse student population of over 2,000 undergraduate and graduate students. A Millikin education features Performance Learning, a unique learning approach offered only at Millikin that gives students the chance to build the confidence and skills to succeed before and after graduation. Millikin offers more than 50 majors in the College of Fine Arts, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Professional Studies and Tabor School of Business, and is located on a 75-acre residential campus in Decatur, Ill. Last year, 99 percent of Millikin graduates gained employment or continued their education within six months of graduation.

Microsoft Corp. is unveiling a raft of product updates and new services in security, artificial intelligence and other areas as the company tries to sustain the growth of its Azure cloud and Office software businesses. At the company's Ignite conference for information technology pros on Monday, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella will introduce new offerings and provide updates that include: * Microsoft Teams — the company's Slack rival — has 329,000 organizations as customers, including 87 of the Fortune 100. * Microsoft Windows and Office apps will have a search box that queries both Bing web search and internal corporate documents and data. 
* Office 365 users can now email and share documents with LinkedIn direct connections from Office apps. * A little lightning bolt icon in Office apps — starting first in Excel and PowerPoint — will provide suggestions for design, layout and images based on what the user is doing. * The company "declared an end to the era of passwords" by adding the ability to login to hundreds of thousands of corporate apps without a password via Microsoft's Authenticator service. (Bill Gates made a similar pledge back in the early 2000s and passwords are still here). The world's largest software company also said it's spending $40 million to put its AI products to work in helping refugees, children and disaster response in conjunction with organizations like the World Bank. Called AI for Humanitarian Action, the five-year program is the latest part of the company's AI for Good initiative begun last year. One program will provide computer vision and facial modeling tools to help surgeons improve cleft palate surgeries for needy kids. The company will also work with the United Nations and World Bank to use AI and data-modeling software for disaster forecasting so the agencies can have supplies in place ahead of time. "AI can be a game-changer in helping aid response," said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, whose unit will oversee the program. Microsoft General Manager John Kahan, who had been leading a team of data scientists tracking key performance metrics for the company's executive team, will oversee the new program and report to Smith. Kahan, who lost a baby son to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, had also been using data science to find new approaches to SIDS prevention. That program will become part of AI for Humanitarian Action.

20 IN THEIR 20S; David Shor

David Shor, 26 Senior data scientist, Civis Analytics
There are people who are good with numbers. Then there's David Shor.
Growing up in Miami, Shor finished high school after ninth grade. He studied math at Florida International University, graduating at 17. The algorithms whiz was working at a hedge fund just as the Great Recession hit. He was in his late teens. "I was arriving (to work) by bus, and other people were driving up in their Porsches," he says.
Shor, the son of a rabbi and a doctor, was also discovering that he was more interested in making a difference than making money. He started blogging about politics in his parents' basement. Eventually, he caught the attention of statistics guru Nate Silver, who offered him a job. Then in 2012-before he was old enough to legally drink-he joined the Obama re-election campaign in Chicago, where it was his job to help track internal and external polls and make forecasts. Shor's team predicted the 2012 election results within 1 percentage point in all 50 states. But he and other pollsters missed the call on the 2016 presidential race.
Now, he and his colleagues at Chicago-based data science firm Civis are rethinking how polling is done. Rather than depending on old-school landline-phone polling, which no longer reaches many segments of the population, Shor's team reworked their data collection system. They rely less on phones and more on analytics and massive databases that have detailed demographic information about voters. In the last year, they correctly called close elections in Virginia, Alabama and Pennsylvania.
"In any room full of smart people in politics, David was always the smartest guy in the room," says Michelangelo D'Agostino, a data scientist who worked with Shor at Civis. "He's freakishly good at math."
Something Shor doesn't really follow is sports, but colleagues tell a story about how he entered an office NCAA tournament pool a few years ago to teach co-workers how to use a new programming language for forecasting. He built algorithms to predict the best picks and the worst-and ended up being right on both counts.
IN FIVE YEARS: "Hopefully there's a Democrat in the White House and Democrats control the Senate and the House, and I can play a role in making policy better."
