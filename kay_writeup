# Before the first comparison plot

To compare the most frequent words for the articles in each region, we generated bar graphs for each region. On the x-axis, we plotted the tf-idf value for the top words for each region. To choose the top words, we grouped by region and used slice_max() to select the top 15 tf-idf values. As evident in the plot, the most common words were vastly different for each region. These differences in words may indicate the prevalence of data science applications to different industries and issues around the nation. For example, the words "rats", "rat", "trash", and "burrows" are all identified in data science articles in the Mid-Atlantic. This may indicate that data science is being applied to solve rat infestations or trash problems in this area. Overall, this graphic is useful in identifying data science applications and references across the United States.

We also wanted to compare the differences in sentiment between the five regions. To do so, we generated histograms to show the count of positive and negative words for each region (using Bing sentiment analysis). It's clear that data science articles in the South and West regions have a stronger negative connotation than elsewhere in the US. Additionally, the Midwest is the only region where the count of positive words outnubmbers the count of negative words. Comparing word sentiment can help when identifying the overall view of data science in regions across the country. Based on this graphic, the data science articles being published tend to contain more negative words, however this may be a result of the application of data science to complex and challenging environmental, political and economic issues across the country.
